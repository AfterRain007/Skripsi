I look at is as a savings acct. A very risky one at that. You should have your safe one in a bank, 401k, etc and also have a small side one of crypto. In time it will grow, especially if you keep pumping Fiat into your wallet. It won't hurt and one day you will be surprised how much you've ammassed.

If you look at the historical charts, especially recently, the oil market prices have foreshadowed what is coming for the stock markets, and other markets in general. And once this happens people will panic and flee to a safe haven, which for now is the US dollar. Gold is starting to show strength as well but it may go down with everything else short term.

Hard to call here for Bitcoin. On the one hand BTC has been mirroring the stock market recently. On the other hand, people eventually will wake up and realize that a trillion dollars is now being printed weekly. The problem with this is that most people (98 percent plus) know next to nothing about crypto or trust it. Likely once the dust settles and more information comes out, then adoption may be accelerated significantly.

Many institutions that are selling all their profits from an over inflated stock market are likely waiting to buy in at rock bottom prices

> Most institutional investors will not buy Bitcoin at rock bottom but at a more convincing bottom than $5900 (once the $6000 BTC resistance is broken, a new hell will break loose and the whales will be directing that crash course).

Institutional investors are there to make money. 2K, 6K, 10K... it doesn't matter. For those who have access to billions, those prices are peanuts.

But there's one thing institutional investors like, and it's assurances. They like to make sure they will get their profit, one way or another. This is where Bitcoin still could fail.

I agree with you in the sense that Whalers will control the next crash, but in my opinion, the whalers are the institutional investors. In my opinion, they are already in the market, making money and moving their pieces into key places of this massive crypto-game. 

Why am I certain of this? Ask yourself. If institutional investors likes assurances, wouldn't they want to have control of the game? They will do what they have been doing in every market. Controlling it. 

Bitcoin is a scarce currency right? Control a large piece of the currency, and you will control the direction of the market. 

HODLER's don't control shit. They are out of the market. They have no influence on the bitcoin market value. Yes, some of them will probably get rich, but not that many.

> From that point on, Bitcoin will soar to new highs $60k/BTC and a crypto market in the trillions. 

Billions would need to enter the market for that and institutional investors are not there to inject value. They are there to profit. To take value out of the market.


>  I made about $6K last night.

Coinbase came close but then randomly decided to put a hold on my funds for 12 days. Gemini is confusing, I bought bitcoin but can’t seem to spend it there either.

Doesn't this remaining room for price discovery just encourage continued speculation and holding versus widespread adoption (which makes it difficult to find the actual stable valuation?)

Imagine if/when Bitcoin is not seen anymore as a risky investment. More fishes are going to get into the game, and also countries. Owning just one BTC is going to be unreachable once more countries start adding BTC to them reserves. 

People call it hopium. I call it evolution. It is a matter of time.

..., if you believe they can dump it the blockchain data says otherwise. Whales dump the Bitcoins pretty often - open short positions - win the bet and then buy for cheaper. Win-win situación. This is going to happend as long as the market cap makes it easy to manipulate. At 10T market cap is going to be harder to move.

15203,"Everything you express points back to the exact same issue with your perspective - you only see how things are and refuse to be open mined. The limitations with fiat are very very simple. It has nothing to do with all these prosesses you are caught up in. You're just outlining the current system and praising how efficient it is now. Which I understand because it's natural to use the present as a measuring stick, and not the future. You almost sound like an accountant with your conservative stance. We're not here to evaluate your knowledge of how the current economy functions. I get it, you want to highlight that and I think it's great that you like to learn.

Bitcoin consolidates numerous processes within one ecosystem. Is that simple enough for you? The technology surrounding fiat is not fiat, it's third party tech. The limitation of fiat is that it will always rely on third party technology. Bitcoin comes packaged with everything needed onboard and can be scaled infinitely. It's ironic that you say I'm not close enough to the technology, when that's the exact component of bitcoin that you are neglecting to acknowledge. All the trusted third parties you refer to that are required in addition to the currency are not the middlemen I am talking about, and you know that. There will also always be a need to borrow, and there will also always be interest rates, and many other moving parts but again, this is irrelevant to the consolidated nature of bitcoin that I'm pointing out as making fiat inferior.

Stop hoping to learn anything from any crypto conversation until you're ready to acccept that bitcoin has graduated far beyond the fad stage, or the forgotten invention stage. It is here to stay and will morph and shapeshift countless times from the original satoshi whitepaper until it becomes what is the most efficient form. Don't you get it? Bitcoin can be made into exactly what we need, but fiat can only ever rely on third party tech to be improved. And that's not even involving the advantages of being global and decentralized.

15451,Alright so there are a couple of things going on here. The first one you have to be aware of or the cycles. You can see this if you look at a 10-year history of the company. Imagine an oscillator. That's how this stock trades. There is something called the Baltic dry index which in layman's terms is what they can charge for shipping. The higher that goes the higher the day rate becomes on the ships. Now if you look at the really big picture on the Baltic dry index in 2016 it bottomed at a lower level than it was trading in the 90s. During the last major cycle which was 2003 to 2009 metals and bulk shipping did really well because China was clicking off at 10% GDP every year. Same with the Emerging Markets. That all crashed along with the housing crisis and a lot of these shipping companies had ships they could not pay for and no one wanting to Charter them. You look at the earnings of a couple of the good names like DSX and ssw and you see them burning money. They were not making any profit. Now back to that Baltic dry index. If you look at 2016 until today you see that series of higher lows. Now you look at the earnings of DSX they went from losing ass loads of money to breaking even with a small profit on this last earnings report. Now you look at the share price. We had to run up to a little over $5 and now we are correcting back down. You have a company with improving earnings and a share price that hasn't really caught on yet. Where is the risk? It's in the macro. If we have a recession or if we have drastically slowing Global growth it could be a negative. However it's extremely unlikely we are going to get anywhere near 2016 levels again. A lot of the ships and over supply have been scrapped or sold. When you look at the rest of Wall Street and some of the high earnings multiples on companies that have been doing well for years I just don't really see the value. I mean people are paying 17 times earnings for Heinz. Yes like ketchup. What I'm doing in a nutshell with DSX is selling parabolic rallies and buying support. The level we are at right now I'm nibbling. I'm not 100% sure if I would say this is a bottom because we don't have any signs of it but again if we look at that chart you see that run up off of a clear double bottom. Now we have the correction. It might do a Fibonacci retracements or it might just be a regular Cup & handle retracement before the next stage takes off. What we don't want to see is the price get back down into the mid 3s. That would be full circle. If we go down to $4 flat to where we are now that is just a good healthy correction. Again the risk is macro. If we have slowing GDP into the back half of the year which is a pretty reasonable possibility it could put a limit on this particular stock but then again a nice horizontal trend is really easy to trade. If you look at the macd right now you will see the histogram trading up which is a bullish Divergence couple that in with the price action and where we are on the oscillator. It just seems like a reasonable time to accumulate a little more so I bought another hundred shares this morning and will keep watching the price action. The worst case scenario is stopping out about 3.90 or cost averaging in the whole way down and waiting for the next cycle. When China starts to accelerate again this thing could really go to town because dry bulk shipping is things like iron ore. Copper etc,-1

> “Our current approximate percentage of renewable power generation in the Bitcoin mining energy mix stands at 74.1%”

Every article so far claiming Bitcoin has a heavily negative carbon footprint is literally **just** looking at the energy expenditure and translating that into conventional energy impact, as if every mining rig is plugged into the country’s main grid through wall sockets.

That’s not how this works because miners need profit and the best profit comes via cheap (ideally free), renewable energy.

Your article is happy to proclaim Bitcoin uses more energy per transaction than a British home does in 2 months, but its a very disingenuous analogy, not least because it’s looking at grid use, and it’s near impossible to mine and make profit while being plugged into something like the UK’s national grid.

So while the energy usage might be high, it’s by far not something that’s dependent on fossil power for the majority of its usage.",-1

Seriously, we get it. You called ""bubble"" over and over until you were right, just like thousands of other armchair economists. We get that you think bitcoin is a ponzi or a pyramid scheme. We get that you think they're digital beanie babies, doomed to sit forever in someone's digital closet collecting dust. We get that you think a limited supply, decentralized, unregulated currency has no chance of ever succeeding.

So my question is - why are you still here? What are you hoping to accomplish by repeating the same arguments over and over? **We heard all the exact same shit in 2011, and here we are two years later, still trading at \~$70.** You aren't going to convince us that bitcoin is dead, or even dying, so why bother? What's your goal here? You won't rest until every poor sap has pulled all their dollars out of BTC so the world economy can get on with business as usual?

.................

Why don't you just come back in two or three years when the next bubble inevitably pops and try to convince us again? **Third time's the charm, right? Will you be using the same arguments if it reaches a high of over $1000 and crashes back to a stable $250?**",-1
