"Just imagine the priority goal as bitcoin accumulation. In 10 years or less it’s probable that adoption will go from ~150 million people currently to at least 1 billion and potentially a lot more. 1 billion users would be a 6.67 fold increase in users from today roughly. That network increase would likely see a corresponding (roughly) increase in price. That’s a $225,000 bitcoin going off of current usd spot. Crude as fuck idea of what could happen but easy enough to understand, realistic and conservatively low imo. 

If that’s a conservative case for bitcoin’s trajectory, a “lower bound” if you shall, then I think it’s an easy bet to make. Even at a 50/50 shot of that outcome *or better*, huge asymmetry. Worth throwing at least something into especially if you’re young and a hustler.",1,,,

"When it trades in an increasingly narrow range for an extended period of time, it is a sign that people are not sure which way the market is going to go.

Then, when it finally breaks out of the narrowing triangle, it usually is a sign that the market has made its mind up about the new trend. If this moves happens quickly, with a high volume, that is a good sign. It means that many traders feel confident that a new trend has started and trade accordingly.

Honestly, I was also expecting a downturn and I would actually have liked the move today to have been even more quick and with more volume. As it is, I'm not entirely convinced that this was it, and am still anticipating that we may see a significant drop in the near future.",0,,,

Who can blame the whales for doing this when people practically beg them to by being morons?

"IMHO. Your value argument is OK. The energy argument is invalid. Energy has to do useful work to create value.

Also, Bitcoin can be an asset for a time, but it is not sound money. Sound money in the modern world must allow growth. A scarce asset cannot do that. That is why gold standard was abandoned, and correctly so. The corruption of the government is something different. But that's not our topic.

If a scarce asset becomes the foundation of economy, it will mean a time tax on the late comers or worse, the next generation. Have the forever appreciating prices of real estate done any good to the younger generation? Forever appreciation of anything that is both scarce and ""required"" means a time tax or punishment. Were you born late? Here's your punishment.

Scarcity leads to conflicts. Scarcity leads to inequality. Capitalism won because it encouraged people to reduce scarcity of the needed resources.

That is why I am convinced Bitcoin cannot win. If it fails, it fails. But if it succeeds, it will create a generational wealth gap far worse than what was done by the real estate. But since it is not a need like real estate, the late comers will reject it and hence it will fail.",,,,

main issue is the price is not keeping up with the hashing. miners are operating at break even right now making VERY little profit per day best case scenario. you start getting these 5700-6400 prices and miners even hodl. then they probably sell around 7500. if we don't get more demand this may continue for some time. daily mining production is substantial and they can absolutely put a floor under the coin if they don't sell. ,,,,

"It has to do with the way blocks are produced.

It's essentially a mathematical puzzle. Essentially, a really long hexadecimal number is produced, and computers try to guess what it is. Whoever guesses it right gets the 6.25 BTC.

The difficulty is adjusted every 2016 blocks (there are 2016 10 minute periods in two weeks). This is meant to keep it at 10 minutes per block, on average. If blocks have been taking longer, difficulty is increased, and vice versa. An increase in difficulty means there are more potential numbers that can be chosen.

If there's less hash power for whatever reason, it'll generally take longer to guess the number, though it hypothetically could take under a second if someone gets really lucky.",,,,

Regret isn't worth giving up on all that \^ and if regret is what's bringing you down, you need to watch a few documentaries about life in the middle-ages, life before that, or pretty much any war docu. There was a time when you'd be minding your own business and then get murdered/pillaged by Vikings or gauls or simply lived with no medical care and even a toothache was deadly. We got it easy. Regret is just one emotion, toughen up bro. The biggest regret of all would be if you did kill yourself, and then regretted that you can't come back.",,,,

The institutional investors are smart enough to know this.

"these are both valid arguments against these coins V BTC. But I think they have their place right now.

I would Add that LTC has value because of the reduced average block time. 2.5 min v 10 min. Quicker conf has its place but youre right by saying a ""testnet of sorts.""

XMR is truly fungible, so is the best crypto ""cash"" at the moment. I have issues with the anonymity of tx's on this chain but I dont know enough about how consensus ensures the cap isnt increased by miners if the amounts are anon. I need to read up more.

I really hope improvements in BTC fungibility in the near future will prevent the need to mix/tumble/join for an extra fee to retain anonymity of sender,receiver and amount. This is what internet cash needs to achieve.

This should all be attempted while keeping tx and block size as small as practical to ensure decentralisation is maintained along with low fees which Im sure is not an easy task. Time will tell if its even possible but the future of BTC is very exciting.

"I stop by to read what’s going on from time to time and want offer word of advice to the less experienced investors. I believe the more time you spend reading random thoughts of others the more likely you will be to pull the trigger on BTC and sell. My advice is to thoroughly research your investments and than monitor circumstances that led you to invest in the first place. For that includes macro economic factors, first and foremost is the continuous printing of paper money and the growing number of third world countries facing economic collapse. What I don’t monitor are the random posts on sites like this telling you BTC will be $1,000,000 or worthless and anywhere in between. 

These people while some are well intentioned have no clue concerning future pricing or timing. I have great deal experience and I believe value BTC will grow significantly based upon my macro economic beliefs that being said I have no idea if it will be $80,000, 100,000, $200,000 by the end of 2021. No one does!

Believe in the reasons why you purchased BTC if those don’t change sit back and let it ride. Don’t check price very often and don’t be swayed by anything you read on this site. Treat this as entertainment purposes only.

I rode Amazon from very low price all the way through $3,000. I would intermittently sell for some reason, each time I did I would buy back later at higher price. I learned lesson don’t over think it and trust in why you purchased asset. All my impulsive trading did was lower my return and increase revenue for brokerage firms.

Just my two cents. The future looks very bright for younger investors smart enough to put whatever they can in BTC",,,,

"Actually, you could argue that of all the available evidence, my argument holds the most weight. 

You could argue that that isn't sufficient evidence for you, but you couldn't argue you have evidence to the contrary and that PP will not be reached.

In what scenario, if NB doesn't come along, does Bitcoin not inflate to infinity with a constantly depreciating dollar?

In what scenario in the future, are bananas not 100 dollars a pound? Something would have to change. Eventually bananas will be 100 dollars a pound. On current evidence we know this to be true unless something changes.

On current evidence, the trend suggest that bitcoin goes up, dollar goes down. On fundamental analysis on how they function, this supports that.

"Don't forget situations like political confiscation, or financial crisis. They happen in to adults non-communist countries too.

Back in 2007 in the last financial crisis, a big fear was that if banks went bust then the financial infrastructure would stop working (ATMs would close, bank transfer wouldn't work, etc, etc). With bitcoin we can have a working financial infrastructure regardless of what risks are taken by investment banks.

Also there's the privacy aspect. Transacting online with legacy methods always involves revealing your real life ID. So for example if you want to buy a VPN for privacy reasons, you always have to give up your real name when you pay with VISA. With bitcoin you can buy a VPN without giving up your real name. This works because decentralization gives rise to irreversible transactions, if you send bitcoins to somebody and they wait for enough confirmations then then nobody can take the bitcoin from you no matter for what reason, no matter how good the excuse, no matter what. This is a property that no centralized online payment system can *ever* have.

Finally because payments are irreversible, it's possible to program the money with smart contracts. You could use smart contracts with centralized payment methods, but the central institution could always override them so it would be pointless. Smart contracts in bitcoin will always be followed no matter what.",,,,

This is according to a study conducted by ING Bank N.V. in Austria, Belgium, Czech Republic, France, Germany, Italy, Luxembourg, Netherlands, Poland, Romania, Spain, Turkey, United Kingdom, United States and Australia.

""Per the survey, which was carried by market research firm Ipsos between March 26 and April 6, 2018, only 9% of Europeans owned a cryptocurrency at the time of polling. However, in the future 25% of those surveyed indicated that they expect to own a cryptocurrency. In the United States, 8% at the time owned cryptocurrencies while 21% said they expected to own some in the future.""
