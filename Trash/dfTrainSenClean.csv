feels a bit tense in here no lol i m a long term holder too so i don t really care the next hrs but i am watching to see if we stay above that feb th low why would a long term holder care because even if those of us who bought over a year are still way up i absolutely do want to see that feb th support level hold and as we all know it s likely that if we break below our feb th low the odds are it will be within the next few weeks every week we stay above that support level the law of permanence creeps into investors minds for many of us we still have a hard time buying because we remember buying at cheaper prices every week this price becomes more part of what is consider the normal price and the memory of buying bitcoin becomes farther and farther into our memories and replaced with the new norm respecting the support level of feb th is a pretty big deal for me because if it doesn t hold then we need to rebuild the permanence of value at the new price gratitude for the people who haven t sold it s a sign of solidarity that i admire,0

please everyone make the best decision for you during this time i keep seeing repetitive phrases such as buy the dip whales are loading up or sell crypto winter is incoming nobody knows where the price is headed and especially not anybody spouting repetitive one liners on reddit simple rule of investing whether it s bitcoin or any other asset do not invest with money that you need in the near future so many people get carried away and think what s the harm this could be the opportunity of a lifetime yes it might be but it could also bankrupt you no matter how bullish you are on bitcoin there is a chance this thing drops a lot lower than this and never recovers to where we are today unlikely in my opinion but it s possible and anybody who says it s not is spilling out their hopes and dreams not certainties if you realised at this point that you made a mistake and need to sell as you need the fiat for living expenses in the coming months and can t risk losing more don t feel ashamed you made a simple mistake that thousands if not millions before you have made and is deep routed in human psychology let it be a lesson albeit a painful one and come back to the table if you want to when you have spare money that you can afford to invest and not worry about summary do what is right for you not what people you don t know on a sub are telling you,0

ever since i read literature about blockchain tech and web potential i am now at crypto exposure i might or might not be brainwashed by those reads but i assessed my risk and have the conviction that blockchain as tech is here to stay do nt really care about it being a currency that is not coming anytime soon tbh,1
lunc all the way,1
bitcoin and the rest of the crypto market has weathered an unbelievable amount of fud for around ten years guess what its still here and some of its biggest critics are now embracing the tech the impact blockchain tech will have on stuff like web decentralised ai supply chain defi to name a few is immense to compare the market to tulips is just wilful ignorance,1
interesting of course people who ve made money on crypto are going to vehemently disagree with you i have about of my portfolio in crypto btc and eth while i fully understand it s risky af i strongly believe it will be profitable in the long run,1
i suspect that bitcoin will succeed but for none of the reasons most people talk about bitcoin does have an inherent value its inherent value stems from its distinct advantages it is uncontrollable and easily launderable bitcoin is the perfect underground currency you can sell drugs with it you can prostitute with it you can sell murder with it bitcoins will have value not because it has any inherent worth but because it will be the only currency you can safely use to conduct illegal transactions want bj on the corner of fu and lapd convert your dollars to bitcoins pay in bitcoins and presto happy ending for you the value of the bitcoin will eventually be set by the flow of money through the currency in the pursuit of illicit goods let s say the daily illicit through transaction market is m that means every day m worth of bitcoins are bought used to purchase illicit goods and services and then sold back into dollars thus however many unique bitcoins happen to be on the market that day they will in total be worth m,1

being able to send funds to another country instantly feelessly and without environmental impact through a clean mobile wallet interface and knowing that there is zero inflation on a decentralized secure network so my funds are safe from theft and inflation gives me a warm fuzzy feeling every time,1
blockchain is slow and expensive it has to be slow so that transactions can be expensive transactions have to be expensive so that they sufficiently incentivize people to stakemine and secure the network there s no recourse in cases of fraud it s an extremely inefficient and uncompetitive system by design,-1

money mate we re all here for the money but at some point you ll just have to love the tech and upgrades offered looking at deip and how they aim to tokenize intangible assets bringing em onchain it s an interesting move for defi as a whole,1

only because of making me money i do nt hate the krs and taxes i do nt hate banks i want to buy land and i mine crypto hoping that thistle bit i have turns into a lot i do nt worry about hiding my earnings and i will gladly pay taxes like i have my whole life,1

i m still bullish on dogecoin my favorite coin right now,1
crypto itself will implode if celsius goes down too eth will take a beating billions will be lost now we know why coinbase made those announcements,-1
the real beauty of crypto is how it cant just be printed up by the government,1
btc is fairly analogous to gold no intrinsic value proof of work gradual supply but limited total amount however btc has several advantages instant transfer does nt need expensive physical storage decentralised anonymous and the blockchain provides an indisputable ledger i was the same as many people here bitcoin seemed like a nonsense but when you start looking at it as a replacement for gold it s difficult to fault it i really feel like it s inevitable that it replaces gold as a store of wealth in the long term comparing it to shares is not the way to look at it although i do nt think share prices is always based on tangible fundamentals,1
the ethereum ecosystem has more developers not just than any competitor it has more devs than every other smart contract platform combined excluding bitcoin it has more devs than every other crypto combined the result of all those developers is innovation every advance in defi has happened first on ethereum other chains have their own dapps but they are almost exclusively clones of things that were developed first in ethereum the amount of value locked in defi just on mainmet is double that on every other chain combined,1
it became a religion akin to old religions people defend their cointoken like it was their chosen greek god waging war against other gods its honestly very interesting but also very cringe at the same time,-1
the total lack of intrinsic value if you re buying commodities or currency backed by a countries economy there will always be some intrinsic value so during times of low value you can hang onto your investment and wait out the storm a crypto investment could go up in smoke and you could lose everything,-1
the only times i ve ever used crypto is for gambling sites and illegal purchases even then it was a ball ache to get sorted,-1
crypto is pure potential it represents hope to the masses and does not discriminate its not racist it does nt give a hotdamn what your preferred pronoun is its algorithmic equality it s a distupter of disrupting tech a virtual revolution that will literally reshape the world adoption has begun and we are further than everyone realizes regulators will try and stop the revolution but it is too late the downtrodden will rise the oppressed will stand in unity oh and it has made me rich not just fiat but rich with knowledge acquired learning to trade and do ta how to better budget and how to plan for my future and my children s futures hopefully generations to come,1
biggest pyramid scheme in the history of the world very impressive no,-1
because it s based on nothing but belief that it has a future i think the level of risk involved the associated shilling manipulation causes people to dislike it it could easily go to tomorrow and you d be left with nothing perhaps worth a punt though but it s not as sound as other invesmtent types discussed on here,-1
i came into the cryptoverse like months ago waaaayy too late i know and for me it have been months of constantly learning about everything from like op say blockchain the tech behind the different coins staking and also how the bank s are screwing us over all the fucking time in many generations so for me crypto is a way to try to get economically independent from the bank s why would i keep my money in the bank s so they have more money to play with so they can become richer and they gives me nothing back fuck them before i entered crypto idspend money on useless things now i think twice before spending i am very humble and thankfully to this sub thanks guys,1
it s the community and the tech the tech enables developers to build powerful applications the large community of developers building apps attracts the large community of users using them the large community of users attracts developers to build apps which attracts users and so on and so on communities and networks are difficult to reproduce and migrate this is why the most successful alternative chains have bridges to ethereum and are compatible with the evm so that all the same apps and tools also work on their network ethereum is at the center of all of this,1
having access to a global currency which opens up options outside of local fiat it s amazing seeing people across different continents cheering on the same currency as me,1
it s only a matter of time i d spread it though at at at and at as bearish as that sounds i believe it will survive a true crypto winter that many alts won t,1
i don t think so crypto recover all coins going down and down,-1
eth is so good because it has the highest level security securing its blockchain you also didnt mention scaling solutions in which will help along with sharding help scale ethereums it is false to say it has reached limit you can build on top of ethereum and extend its capacity there is a reason why redditts is choosing to have their community points secured by ethereum its high fees are a result of so many applications and users fighting for its limited blockspace although fees are high now i expect in years once scaling solutions in mature and deliver fees will be extremely low as users will not be interacting with etheruem but will be using other layers for general interaction this is why i think eth is going to kin the medium term because ppl seem to think it will be this way forever and cant look passed the immediate in short term because ppl who want the best security will use ethereum and eventually theyll be able to do it at very very low cost all while inherenting the security of etheruem on these ls it isnt zero sum and i see other blockchains beinjg widely used due to the huge amounts in of demand for blockspace but if ethereum delivers and ls all come together then the main negative and think probably keep price down and stopping growth are fixed and i see ethereum really coming into its own esp over a timeframe,1
it s great to get paid for heating a swimming pool or a house but that s just a bonus if you mine and only look in bitcoin terms i think it ll turn out to be a great investment,1
crypto have taught me ethics and economic culture how to control emotions and stuffs taught me to be diligent to learning also and that s why i m learning muse before investing in though it s looking promising,1
exactly remember the party is just getting started join before its too late,1
and no millionaires are made from a shit coin,-1
you guys keep repeating this doesn t make it true doge won t have the rebounds like bitcoin because bitcoin doesn t have an endless supply,-1
tell them about crypto currency so they can invest in bitcoin when they go back,1
soon goes to zero,-1
prolly going to get downvoted but it s not it s speculative look at the top largest businesses you can invest in around then look at cryptocurrencies of businesses from that era are still around look how many cryptocurrencies that were popular that are still known it s less than with higher risk comes higher reward but do nt let that blind you from the fact that cryptocurrencies are the riskiest investment there is,-1
the problem is not so much that these thousands of cryptos do nt do anything it s that they all do the same thing so many of them are just copied and pasted with little or no difference and that limits use cases for each one the market is diluted and that means many chains will just fade into obscurity,-1
cryptocurrency is bad for the environment because mining and transferring cryptocurrency essentially getting crypto and sending to someone else requires a lot of energy essentially crypto requires a computer to do a bunch of really complex math equations and those draw a lot of power,-1
investments are based on investing in the work of others you have bonds which loan money to companies who make sure of those funds and pay you interest out of their profits you have equities which invest in companies and then share in their profits crypto does nt have any underlying assets there s no company doing work generating profits to generate value interest or dividends the value is wholly based on confidence in th value of the cryptocurrency there s no real value or work being done to convey value because of the way it generates value it s more like a ponzi scheme than an investment because of that i do nt like seeing people recommend it as an investment because there s no floor in the value there are no assets or businesses or profits to drive the value so a serious crisis in confidence could see the value fully collapse to zero with proper investments there s a floor the value of the underlying assets within the companies shares may trade above that based on expectations of future success but there is a floor and you know that in any market crash your assets may become undervalued for a while but they exist as shares in tangible companies with tangible profits and assets tl dr it s too close to a ponzi scheme and there re no assets or profits driving the value,-1
i bought crypto just to surf on hype retard wave i do not beleieve crypto to be long term investment and think vast majority people are there just for quick gains as well,-1
full audit of usdc too,-1
its potential to both disrupt markets and offer services and solutions on a blue ocean level and i m excited to see how the blockchain will change gaming in the coming decade,1
people do nt want to lose all their money with a typo,-1
i ve still yet to hear a use case that would cause me want to own bitcoin even if i were living in argentina and trying to safeguard against inflation i would still buy usd who wants something that drops in a matter of months,-1
not gon na trust this horrific guy and never gon na invest on luna ever,-1
this is only a problem to those who do nt understand the full potential of bitcoin bitcoin is nonpermissioned nonsurveilled esp lightning pure trade if for whatever reason this is valuable to you you will spend your bitcoin and if bitcoin is more valuable to you than fiat you will replenish your bitcoin by buying more bitcoin see how that works if you would rather not have some coorporation looking over your shoulder for every payment you ll opt to pay in bitcoin just saying,1
the ultimate gift to money launderers tax evaders and regimes circumventing sanctions as if it was nt easy enough already pyramid schemes and other types of large scale fraud have never been quicker or easier super easy to lose everything to phishing or an exploit energy consumption of pow a new avenue for gambling addicts to be created or suffer relapse beyond the rug pulls and meme coins most projects are still massively inflated bubbles because the vast majority of buyers know shit about fuck and just want to get rich quick,-1
personally i invest in btc and eth reason diversification if the trend of getting everything online and the whole metaverse thingy continues then gains will also continue the rate of adoption is increasing consistently eth is a whole new ecosystem with insane amount of applications sure other better crypto could replace it but so could a better search engine replace google and yet i m not too worried about that btc is the first real moneypropertystore of value whatever you want to call it which gives you complete control is decentralised and predictable you can see the code,1
massive ecosystem pretty much all applications and a shitload of developers in crypto are on ethereum and pretty much all applications on other chains are forks of what has been developed on ethereum which says a lot just look at the top cryptocurrencies how many of them are tokens on ethereum a majority decentralization and safety ethereum could have lower fees by sacrificing decentralization like many other chains do but they do nt skimp on these values and in doing so they put safety first and even if ethereum did sacrifice decentralization it only goes so far and it is something all chains will face once users increase solution to the scalability trilemma ethereums solution is rollups and sharding rollups are being implemented right now and haswill drastically decrease fees sharding will plummet them even further whenever it arrives the future is that people do nt use layer on ethereum but use the rollups on layer you can preview this by buying eth on cryptocom withdrawing onto arbitrum still quite high fees while in beta and use on curve finance just like you would with ethereum layer or avalanche,1
allways wanted to invest money in to stoks but it is unnecessary complicated and expensive plus the returns you get with stoks are most often just inflation crypto has everything it is accessible it is cheap it can return huge gains it operates and i know a thing or two about technology,1
i first bought bitcoin in i honestly just liked the idea of sending money online in a trustless manner seemed revolutionary to me and i was right,1
the sooner this trash falls the better fuck justin sun,-1
me likes the coin,1
it s a decentralized ponzi scheme just because no one person or entity is orchestrating it does nt mean it does nt have the hallmark mechanisms of a ponzi scheme do profits come from anywhere else but new investors that is the only question needed to establish whether or not it s a ponzi scheme some of them do promise large returns and the rest while they may not directly promise it certainly insinuate it chanting have fun staying poor is an indirect way of asserting that you know it will go up leaving nonholders poor the entire hodl doctrine that s pushed is the philosophy that you will make large returns if you hold long enough do nt play dumb if it s not direct promises it s everything short of that the entire subculture is built on it and of course they do try to attract new members why is there advertising in the super bowl on wall street in nba stadium names why do they try to orange pill friends and family,-1
the creator is a shady pos like do kwon,-1
there s no winning with this unless you re extremely lucky pure gambling,-1
i m pretty sure most of the transactions on the blockchain are an orchestrated pump and dump,-1
there is no demand tho lol bitcoin has no actual value,-1
far too many shitcoins,-1
no ceo making fake promises no problems that s why bitcoin is king,1
let s go btc,1
the drug dealers and dark web users and the money laundering they really making crypto look bad,-1
shitty ethereum bye bye,-1
t s a hustle it s not an investment you only have to look at the way it s portrayed on social media where its pumped with all the enthusiasm that travelling salesmen used to peddle snake oil in olden days it s a gamble where you hope to find some mug willing to pay more for it than you did and you re not the one that is left holding the bag it has no intrinsic value and despite all the white papers in the world it does nt do what it says on the tin people who have it have it purely for convincing an idiot to pay more than they did people argue how the coins are currencies and how it s all decentralised money yet they constantly do nothing but compare the value of the crypto they own to fiat currencies because basically it has no purpose and outside of true stablecoins which at least can be used for a cheap way to transfer money without the risk of their value changing within seconds because of its volatility never will i own crypto but at least i m honest and say the reason i do it is because of the sole purpose of hoping that the money that s in other peoples pockets ends up in mine i do nt bullshit like far to many do especially those investing in meme coins like doge and shib,-1
cause a future payment systems talking about backend here are gon na be using blockchains b through crypto we can have decentralized finance effectively cutting out the middle man bank and start earning yield on our assets,1
i have held my bitcoin since i have bought and sold loads of other crypto but have never sold my bitcoin as long as you re not expecting immediate riches and can tolerate some paper losses go for it,1
the biggest con job in history more than do kwon nobody buys your bs stfu,-1
two words free fall,-1
bitcoin gold i still do nt understand how it gained so much value for what it is,-1
great post it s so easy to make money in crypto with patience and a long time horizon invest in sound projects during dips and plan your returns years from now and not weeks from now be a patient value investor and stop trying to pick the winning numbers this isn t a lottery ticket it s fundamental investing principles stop clickingreadingwatching anything that says this coin will x by this time stick to strong fundamentals and you will easily x your investments in years which probably doesn t seem that sexy but is a remarkable return,1
honestly the most attractive thing to me about crypto has been how it has literally paid me to learn shit i ve got a half dozen degrees diplomas and certifications in a couple of really different fields i love learning clearly everything i studied was in the pursuit of career opportunities because i also love making a comfortable living but i paid to learn all that stuff i put in time and money for a delayed payoff crypto it actively pays me to be learning about macroeconomics finance infrastructure coding politics sociology gaming art marketing,1
crypto is an immature market with a high degree of volatility with traditional investments you can hold for growth or you can day trade of people hold and even some of that remaining probably should nt be day trading with crypto there is no meaningful average return and this means that crypto is very difficult to fit within any accepted investment strategy,-1
just added mil to my bag long term stay strong bada bing bada boom,1
to be fair a guy on this sub made a guide on how to make a shitcoin and literally called it buttcoin and it pumped so i m not surprised at this point,-1
almost as bad as ape with this you expect it to fail with ape though you never know when they are going to pump it and dump it,-1
it s not safe we could lose this week and take years to recover or it could take a month heck we just had a drop usually when people say safe they are referring to lack of volatility consistent returns and limited losses crypto most definitely is not that,-1
and it s going to go up i might get hated on but ethereum is the best smart contract platform right now with the amount of dapps and smart contracts it has there s no competition,1
the hype around nft collectibles is a very very bad thing why someone would throw down thousands or even hundreds of thousands on a jpeg monkey that looks exactly like five thousand other jpeg monkeys except with different color teeth is beyond me the current nft market is a giant bubble ready to burst when it does it will punish those who create nfts that are actually unique and artistic rather than just being randomly generated modifications of the same image,-1
bitcoin is more like natural dmt floating in your brain everyone has the possibility to access it without cost you process it read it understand it then define it without any middlemen they can slow it down they ca nt stop the flow,1
why would crypto help it s value is shockingly unstable and they would need to convert it into cash for that money to have real liquidity also they ve been talking about using crypto as a form of exchange for developing nations for years and it still hasn t been adopted there s no upside to crypto as a way to send money and lots of downsides,-1
decentralized internet seems cool smart contracts voting titles deeds and what not digitized and on the blockchain,1
i like the decentralized nature of crypto and the gains are nice too,1
there has been three fraudulent scam coins from do kwon and the terra team basic coin look it up his first failed stablecoin where people lost everything luna v ust and now the luna v scam this guy is going to fucking ruin crypto for everyone this is one case where the scammers do and terra need to be held accountable and made an example out of hopefully,-1
developing countries that do nt have traditional banks but have internet connections will be able to conduct business a lot more efficiently,1
well of crypto are shitcoins and scam coins,-1
im going to smoke and still buy more bitcoin,1
i m in crypto since and so far i found no usecase transfer of money is the only that comes to mind and defi well that so far only cost me money,-1
you think bitcoin will keep rising with an infinite percentage one day it will crash and stay down noob,-1
i use xrp for that i can send thousands of dollars in under seconds with zero fees,1
love it the tech is just so damn cool mixed with all of our current and upcoming technologies it s gon na continue to be a wild ride,1
i m also very excited for when ethereum moves from pow to pos that should remove the greatest criticism as several studies estimate a reduction of around in energy costs furthermore eth is working hard towards improving its transaction rate which it will need if it wants to challenge the likes of visa or mastercard which process orders of magnitude more transactions ps,1
i have buy orders spread across bear market game accumulate,1
celsius destroyed the ust peg and caused retailers to lose huge amount of money they will do anything and everything to recover money when push comes to shove,-1
lel useless ghost chain that will be dead in a few years no one cares about ada besides ada tards,-1
i ve been buying for years and it keeps going up no matter what is said and no matter how volatile it is years of that alone is proof enough for me that crypto is nt going anywhere,1
if only they knew that bitcoin is starting to take off today,1
it s going on sale i m gon na get so fat on bitcoin that when i sell it people are going to call me a whale,1
environmental impact bitcoin alone has the environmental impact co emissions of some small countries for a currency that is primarily used for stored value not transactions this is incredibly problematic assuming there will be no transformational breakthroughs in computing efficiency proof of work is going to be with us and obfuscating the long term value of crypto complexity my smart nontechy friend literally just put k into titan s crypto fund because he did nt trust himself to not make a costly error in purchasing the coins i advised him on he s in his early s and works for a tech company still not confident of transacting in the coins themselves that s going to continue to be a problem of broad adoption scammy coins this thread loves to shit on elizabeth warren for trying to regulate the crypto space i think her heart is in the right place but often gets the details wrong buuuuut if we want broad adoption we need zero news stories of people getting rug pulled hacked etc regulation specifically around verification of project fundamentals would be incredibly valuable to giving consumers confidence in what they re purchasing prevent people from being rug pulled and becoming a crypto detractor littleedge case consumer utility self explanatory until there are actual broad consumer market applications we re all still rolling dice in a casino,-1
currency is only useful if it can be exchanged for goods and services to an extent you can trade it to buy your local country s currency so that s cool but mostly right now it s too volatile to be reliable as a medium of exchange,-1
the best thing about crypto i earn more per week staking than i did for the last years of interest the bank was giving me combined banks are literally robbing people of their money they are running one of the most successful scams in the world,1
i ve found that nearly all coins are either useless or are only there to serve a purpose or problem that the other coins themselves create like governance tokens do nt need those if no crypto proctopcs where you can lend crypto so others can borrow crypto so they can buy crypto it s a nearly fully selfreferential and closed loop system i real ed that got ros of all ambitions and dreams about it and just be a cold blooded trader it helped,-1
a brand new shitcoin to buy monkey pictures,-1
diversification seems to me that it recently got enough traction that it wo nt die lots of young people believing in it can buy etfs more and more politicians and traditional finance people mentioning it etc also it s just cool that said it s only a tiny part of my portfolio though rising despite not paying in and i m prepared for it to go to,1
like traditional gold it lacks intrinsic value it doesn t produce anything or create cash flow and almost nobody seems to fully grasp how it works the underlying blockchain technology might prove to be tremendously valuable but at this point it s difficult to see why any one type of digital coin should be considered so valuable without much obvious nonillicit utility,-1
do kwon cashing out billion before collapse is the biggest con job in history,-1
no shit crypto is nt safe at all between the volatility rugpulls honeypots and other scams if there s one thing we do nt have is safety thus the higher returns are what make this market survive,-1
bitcoin is young give it some time give it a chance you won t be sorry,1
ten years ago i put my down payment money into bitcoin instead of real estate it s up about x bitcoin s price continues to grow at a very rapid rate long term average you see there were good reasons for bitcoin s rapid rise most of those reasons still exist in fact today there are even more good reasons than there were or years ago it is reasonable to expect the long term average growth rate of bitcoin to stay very high for the foreseeable future real estate has significant holding costs eg taxes maintenance insurance sometimes fees interest real estate is nt very liquid and it has extremely high transaction costs ultimately the price of real estate and rents is limited by incomes for example in the long run people ca nt pay more for mortrent than they earn realistically they might be able to afford or percent of their net income for a place to live thus real estate prices are limited by incomes in the long run incomes tend to barely keep up with inflation looking at long term historical data such as caseshiller for popular real estate markets we see in fact that real estate prices barely track the rate of inflation especially when the significant holding costs are properly accounted for bitcoin has no such limit bitcoin has no holding costs bitcoin is liquid bitcoin transactions are typically very little bitcoin s price has been more than doubling every year long term average and as mentioned before can reasonably be expected to continues its rapid ascent real estate is currently in a bubble as evidenced by the pricetoincome ratios the current bubble will pop as the prior bubble eventually had to pop real estate is nailed down bitcoin can be taken with you to anywhere in the world real estate is a sitting duck for higher taxes real estate can be confiscated when the private keys are properly stored bitcoin can not be confiscated knowing all this a person would be a total idiot to purchase real estate instead of investing in bitcoin having said that i do plan on eventually using a small fraction about or percent of my bitcoin holdings to buy my dream home and to pay for it with bitcoin but still end up sitting on a serious stack of sats i have zero regrets for investing in bitcoin instead of real estate and i never will,1
for me i see it as a completely speculative asset i ve bought some in the past made a bit of money off it and sold what i don t like about it because it s so immature it can be legislated to oblivion also that it doesn t have any sizeable use cases yet other than trading it and money laundering i can t see it becoming used as a currency as deflation inherently built into it as well as its price volatility is an impediment also the story of store of value is weak when you consider that its price fluctuates massively unlike traditional assets the only thing i can see is international payments but this will end up being done without needing any of the cryptos out there no matter what the narrative i feel and believe that everyone is just holding to maximise their returns then dump their bags to someone else who s hoping to do the same as there is no underlying asset to underpin the value of the coin other than supply and demand if demand collapses the price will as well it s open to manipulation insider trading and so forth these have been largely regulated out of the mature stock markets while crypto is the wild west right now it s not diversified enough a tracker find tracks thousands of companies while something like that doesn t exist in the crypto sphere to provide a notion of stability it s like investing in a super volatile stock i d be happy to speculate with some play money but it s lack of regulation is putting me off from making it a primary investment choice,-1
eth has the most development going on and that s ultimately more important than the blockchain itself but it s not useable by most people right now it s not a finished product no crypto can really justify it s market cap with performance at this point that s why people say we re still early there is speculative value placed on cryptos that may or may not pan out with the eth roadmap eth has the best chance to be scalable and developer friendly,1
i am yet to see any useful use case come out of crypto that ca nt be done without it easily people will jump on decentralization but it wo nt remain decentralized its already getting more and more centralized governments will never let it be a happyplaygroundforcryptobros so that point is already dead aside from that its basically useless,-1
i would say of all the crypto currency s out there it s a sad fact that we are lucky if half of them are safe investments,-1
who is still investing in this kwonartist coin,-1
the situation has not changed over the past decades fortunately bitcoin is here to give us an alternative to this system by allowing us to take back the power over money,1
so many things destroy this planet faster than bitcoin mining but we do nt hear about it crypto uses a little bit more energy and everybody is up with pitchforks,1
dot is the real deal with bank level security and stability kusama was essentially a copy of dot developed to test new updates in a real world and real economic environment before implementing on dot it ensure dot always runs smooth and never goes down or has security breaches most of the projects on dot will also have a sister network on kusama that will essentially do the same thing but will get new features and capabilities first it s also cheaper to use in general kusama is turning into an art and gaming hub because of this which is really cool so moonrivermoonbeam karuraacala heikoparallel khalaphala etc are just the kusamadot sister networks same teams building them the kusama versions will just have more features than the dot versions,1
the intrinsictrue value of all crypto is that s not hyperbole that s just an objective fact about any virtual currency i guess the same is true of fiat money too in any big disaster scenario where society collapses it s likely they would both become equally worthless pretty much immediately even if the internet somehow continued running no one would be interested in your crypto as soon as there is scarcity and insecurity on that scale physical goods are all that matters it s possible that gold could come into use but you d have to be confident that other people are interested in it before taking it yourself in an exchange because you may end up starving to death on a pile of shiny metal otherwise,-1
too many scams no inherent value disliked by the financial institutions i rely on used by criminals seemingly random value mostly based it seems on manipulating the market environmental impact,-1
it is a currency yet no one uses it as a currency you ca nt use it to buy things around town or from major online stores bitcoin you can especially in places like venezuela venezuela is actually a great example of how it s good for the world because it exists they can feed their family off farming in runescape rather than starve to death because of the dictatorship oppressing them,1
i ve lost money on every single crypto buy and have never sold,-1
better returns on investment than stocks although more volatile borderless transactions far better apy staking crypto than leaving money in the bank protection from inflation of my local currency my local currency loses value like per fortnight at this point,1
debanking access to bankinglike services for people who currently have no access to banks cheap transfers of money like remittances to family abroad smart contracts securing ownership information reducing need for expensive notaries i see crypto as the new industrial revolution the new internet it s the next step in how we live i believe that in tenfifteen years we will look back to society without blockchains everywhere the same way we look back to society without smartphones we remember what it was like but going back is just about impossible and our kids don t understand it at all,1
not a chance the dumping will just get worse no burning going on either circulation supply has nt changed by coin lol,-1
people have used salt seashells cigarettes etc as money because money is what we call the good or tool that is used as money the is used to store value to exchange for other goods as a unit of account a goods or tool becomes money when it is used as money in a prison cigarettes becomes money when that is the goods used for money different goods or tools can be better or worse money depending on the qualities it has there is no requirement that it has to be tangible or physical the requirements are that is has to do its job more or less it has to work as a store of value means of exchange unit of account and to do so it has to be fungible transportable and durable easy to verify etc bitcoin has all those properties and is designed to excel at all of them some say it does not store value because it is too volatile but bitcoin does not contain volatility the volatility is caused by other humans and volatility is not a problem as long as it has remained in value or increase in value between time a and time b the volatility in between does not matter at all so far that requires could require that you hold it for more than years but it will go down and become better and when it does it becomes even more valuable as more and more people see that it is here to stay and see that they can trust that it stores value and even increase in value so far it have and it seems like a given that it will continue to work and i would not bet against bitcoin gold is not bad but today it does not work as a means of exchange for daily items and it probably can not as people will not go back from digital digital is superior at saving time and being verifiable,1
crypto is giving us an avenue to not just be passengers in the financial world,1
cryptocurrency is a long term investment in this dip newbies are panic selling which is a good thing as this is opportunity to buy low and sell high in future it s the game of patience more you hold more you gain,1
how many times do people have to get burned before they learn not to trust this guy,-1
green energy is already widely used for mining bitcoin according to a recent report bitcoin miners have already been using of their total electricity through sustainable or renewable sources for the members of the council the usage is even better,1
bitcoin is a lot of things right now it s a doomsday currency it s an inflation hedge it s a speculative asset it s central banking hedge it s a technology play plus hundred more things all of things are components of its price and value people buy sell and hold for different reasons you can t look at it and say why is it dropping due to inflation it s a hedge against inflation also you can t say it s a hedge against central banks because monetary policy and central banks is in probably one of the worst spots it s been in a while yet btc isn t at an all time high btc is wearing many hats right now don t let anyone tell you it s not any one of a number of different things,1
given that crypto is fundamentally deflationary and limited in supply it makes for a terrible currency currency s purpose is not be an investment but to facilitate trade deflationary currencies always gain value due to limited supply which means people will just sit on them instead of transacting with them inflationary currencies on the other hand incentivize people to use them for goods or investments as they are actively losing value,-1
i plan to invest a small amount every month,1
i really doubt it s this deep i m assuming his fans are just greedy hopeful people and do kwon knows how greedy people are in the crypto space and he knows even if he fucks up once he can do it again a few times it s like trust means nothing anymore if you can make them money,-1
yes governments ban it one major thing though is that the entire backbone of crypto liquidity is through a stable coin called tether they are a complete scam and are already banned in ny once the sec finds out that their coins which should be backed by one us dollar are backed by nothing i believe the feds will shut down exchanges because it has become one huge ponzi scheme,-1
apecoin is going to become a worse version of shib ie not enough pump but still the same dump reason because logic,-1
just buy real gold instead of the crypto version paxg serves no real purpose,-1
the record we did nt need,-1
crypto is the future plain and simple buy or perish,1
i bought bitcoin and other cryptos because i believe in them if you do nt have that feeling about your investments you re simply better off on the sidelines,1
daddy bitcoin is indeed the king,1
this is good i ll buy more,1
harmony one algorand cardano solana vechain gon na fly if there is ever a next bull market otherwise just buy and stack satoshis,1
of shitcoins dont even survive a bull market,-1
it was backed by luna until it was nt the project failed idk why people are buying do kwon s bullshit again fool me once shame on do kwon fool me twice not happening,-1
monero is probably the best coin we have atm change my mind,1
going to crash peoples lively hoods,-1
i m old might not be around in more years that s too long a ways out to speculate about anything btc is the beginning the present and lots of the future still everything else is a gamble,1
it has been my defacto gold stable for years now and i am really pleased with it i tested their exchange mechanism and picked up some gold to verify the tokens being burned in that process,1
i m skeptical about solana due to its low public allocation launch the solana team and vc backing leave retail investors liable to be dumped on not saying it will happen but you never know,-1
we all like vet,1
this is the way buy low buy high the only time i sell is when i spend it on something lol,1
just buy it now and forget about it trust the process,1
eth eth has proven itself in a real operational environment i ca nt stress this enough it is also safe from the sec,1
do kwon s arrogance was terra s downfall so many examples of dumb ass tweets from him,-1
it s a pretty easy win imo just got ta hold it till next btc ath and you re literally guaranteed a x at current prices,1
so many things are worse for the environment than crypto it just seems like this statement is used as a default disagreement against crypto,1
because he does nt understand bitcoin there is bitcoin as an asset there is bitcoin as a payment network the payment network alone operate more efficiently with less fee than companies like western union it also is more secure and transparent than swift buffer should ask himself how much went into developing swift and that s pretty much the cost basis of bitcoin as a payment network bitcoin is like fiat except it is more neutral and universal than majority of fiat out there,1
eth is overpriced and doesnt deserve to be biggest alt,-1
bitcoin has been more stable than these stocks i chose that are less stable,1
i still see a completely speculative instrument i hesitate to call it an asset with no underlying value other than the technology upon which it rests of which could be adopted rather quickly by the federal reserve banking system blockchain i see an unregulated market that is likely to face more and more regulation both domestically and internationally as we move forward,-1
mega bullish on dot,1
yeah pretty much this other blockchains definitely have improved technology kudos to their devs but eth has so many brilliant or excited people working on it at least x the number of devs and that might be conservative so etheruem and layers on ethereum are likely here to stay for some time and be a proving ground testing ground for things for a while it does not mean that other things are not going to thrive quite the contrary just do nt expect ethereum to suddenly become null anytime soon,1
same i spent months annoyed that prices were high and now i get another run at it,1
tether it s sort of an open secret they do nt have enough funds it will crash eventually and it s going to take everything down big time,-1
literally on the same flippin boat done with these crappy tokens that rely on news plays and tweets,-1
there has been three fraudulent scam coins from do kwon and the terra team basic coin look it up his first failed stablecoin where people lost everything luna v ust and now the luna v scam this guy is going to fucking ruin crypto for everyone this is one case where the scammers do and terra need to be held accountable and made an example out of hopefully,-1
he s just exposing how pointless crypto is,-1
eth is great but matic is the way,1
if it s supposed to act as a currency it kinda sucks at it,-1
investigate the bitcoin stock to flow model if you re new you would nt want to bet against a m btc it s really not if but when sustainably above m i d say around the real question is what will the purchasing power of m usd be in years,1
buy there was a dip,1
ethereum is a robinhood character in reverse it steals from the poor and gives to the rich gas fees pure extortion and only a matter of time before the alt coins close in on ethereum,-1
to is a loss but then to is another loss it can always get worse,-1
also your btc is your btc government can not take it from you,1
dollars are going down bitcoin is going down but the purchasing power of dollar is down and btc is still in between you can see mass adoption of btc in future,1
let s call it what it is a scam rugpull and ponzi scheme,-1
do nt hit me but moons they do nt really have an utility and it s too easy getting them by shitposting,-1
yup still mega bullish on dots canary chain kusama also,1
acab all cryptos are bad,-1
such negativity bitcoin has held up well it often trades with the nasdaq simply because traders trade but there are times of divergence it has outperformed a bearish nasdaq this year so it is hedging it s not a magical hedge but it s a very strong unhacked financial network with a finite supply btc dominance over other crypto has been rising again as runaway inflation weakens fiat naturally btc will hedge to a degree it has historically been more volatile though so you ca nt depend on it as a short term hedges,1
laugh all you want but it s practically inevitable that a crypto coin will take over as the world exchange currency it would take a pretty big reversal at this point for it to not be bitcoin but i suppose it s possible,1
bitcoin literally produces security on the order of times greater than the world s fastest supercomputer,1
i am buying more,1
luna is going to be the easiest x this year it s a fully developed ecosystem in a box soon these fudders are going to be whining about missing the boat lol,1
link is good and cheap right now i ve been increasing my chain link position lately,1
love it keep on filling bags at bargain bin prices,1
you will not loose it all do nt bring up luna excuse me while i kiss the sky but wtf do nt bring up luna as a matter of fact bring it the fuck up it s the perfect example of how a top coin can be obliterated in days and why hold no matter what it s just stupid hodl is for btceth,-1
haven t been in a while but the last time i visited rterraluna it was completely overrun by these detached moonbois yet only a few pages further were people contemplating suicide mind boggling,-1
congratulations you have achieved bitcoin understanding level nobody knows how many levels there are i m on level bitcoin is the most beautiful invention ever,1
did they cash out what assholes i have a hardon for btc but i m pretty sure most cryptos are scams made to jump on the hype train,-1
i believe this good luck stretches to me the newness of polkadot is a way of seeing opportunities that has never been seen on other chains before equilibrium for instance has a very low interest rate for borrowing not to talk of the low collateral,1
yeah but doge is going down way faster,-1
as a developer yes it s good in large part because of its first mover advantage ethereum has the largest and most active community of developers by a factor of i would estimate this is a massive advantage for any technology platform it means there is great documentation tools apis and resources that make it easy to learn and build with got an obscure question about the feature you re building there s probably some help guide stack overflow post or youtube tutorial to answer it and that massive developer community also makes it much easier for startups and businesses to hire engineers who already have experience and for any new skills again they can often just google the answer that s probably not what you expected to hear you likely wanted some analysis of tps or scalability ethereum chose the most logical solutions for scalability a lightweight layer pos system with sharding and excellent layer options for high transaction throughput and because they have been focused on that goal longer than any other project they are by far the most reliable robust and decentralized smart contract platform available,1
right ada is by far the leader when in comes to stacking i strongly believe in this coin,1
omfg its going up,1
crypto gains depend on a greater fool to buy in after you ve bought it of course someone with of their portfolio in bitcoin is going to shill it the reality is that crypto has really only exploded so spectacularly is because speculation loves low interest rates and easy money and that has been the world we live in since the origin of bitcoin as monetary policies tighten speculation shits the bed as is happening now,-1
open your eyes guys do nt give your funds to manipulators,-1
correct xrp is pure speculation and zero delivery,-1
it s like the only stable thing on stable coins is the name they go yeah it s not really pegged to a dollar anymore but too many did nt care about it,-1
do nt dwell on altcoins much cause that is how you become homeless,-1
ca nt go wrong with eth,1
i didn t invest in xrp when it crashed because it was a much riskier option than other projects at the time doesn t make sense to invest into something that is having issues almost all cryptos are going to go up in a bull market i don t feel bad at all for not investing in xrp not one bit,-1
the network is a disaster constantly having issues i can t even send sol to my defi wallet because it keeps failing,-1
bitcoin is going to win traditional finance is obsolete hey guys let s only trade during business hours lol hey i can move this without anybodys permission,1
i agree this is why i am holding most of my crypto in coins i believe in and use coins with promissing technology,1
well i fully believe crypto is here to stay so i m happy i can increase my position on btc and eth,1
rollercoasters go back up this is what you call the view from halfway down,1
shit coin shit coin nothing nada rien nichts,-1
its really good most secure and most decentralized chain other projects might look good because they sacrifice decentralization for scalability which is useful for a lot of people until it isnt,1
i m actually excited because i had cash on the side for moments like this,1
ethereum is secure ls built on top of a secure network includes everything you mentioned as better in those other networks that are not even near ultrasound money,1
i do nt like bitcoin at all,-1
unbelievable i lost k to do kwon which was a third of my whole portfolio and for me a lot of money i m really done with this guy,-1
they re moving from ponzi scheme to cult real fast it s like lularoemonat for dude bros lmao,-1
because a good portion of the alts are actually built on it ethereum does have the first mover advantage and it s actually good would nt be where it is today if it did nt have both,1
i see a rapidly deflationary market where those with more and more wealth chase diminishing returns because they re still returns while they keep trying to con other people into buying in because without someone holding the bag the market crashes,-1
ca nt go wrong with btc and eth,1
its gon na bounce back by the weekend,1
macro economics are looking like shit the only thing you re looking at is a bull trap,-1
dont worry btc k end of june,1
the main point is that bitcoin lacks any ability to give you access to cash flows,-1
you re defending a pile of shitcoin with a postitnote that says dollar as being a legitimate asset tracked to the dollar no it s a shitcoin in disguise that s why the peg did nt hold,-1
bitcoin just had a headstart and it s issuance has been lower over the past years after the merge ethereum will have both the superior technology and monetary policy and the market cap will follow at some point,1
i used to despise bitcoin cash now i do nt and actually see the value in it this is why politics i used to think that bitcoin cash was a traitor and to be avoided at all costs i thought how can anyone trust an ecosystem if bitcoin the coin that everyone holds and believes in ends up being dethroned why would anyone invest in this space if king btc is no more these were my thoughts in up until just the other day now i have come to terms that bch is not just a copy and paste clone of bitcoin every single bitcoin holder on the planet received an equal amount of bitcoin cash because it was a forked from bitcoin this means that even if bitcoin cash became the cryptocurrency that bitcoin holders have no one to blame but themselves if they do nt own an equal portion of bitcoin cash it was given to them for free i guess the more and more i have thought about it bitcoin cash is bitcoin because it has the same previous transaction history and literally everyone holding bitcoin received an equal amount of bitcoin cash this was no money grab bitcoin may or may not scale with its small blocksize we should be thanking bitcoin cash for being created to give a counter argument to see if increasing the blocksize ends up being good for scalability and fees and if it ends up being the cryptocurrency because of this who cares everyone holding bitcoin during the time of the fork holds an equal amount of bitcoin cash and if they do nt then that is on them not sure why it took me years to have this epiphany but i did and wanted to share what are your thoughts on bitcoin cash,1
totally how i feel ada should me way more hyped,1
banned for going it is a ponzi and not going well acgtually it is a distributed decentralized mlm scheme shilling a centralized database which is stored in a decentralized matter on which people can only write via a convoluted decrentralized way which due to negative sum nature of the mechanisms leads to the scheme needing and ever increasing supply of fiat electronics and power or it will collapse this system also benefitsthe people who bought in early ocer those who buy in late aka a mlm with extra steps which is a pyramid scheme with extra steps which is a ponzi with extra steps,-1
crypto is just another scratch it ticket and tax on the poor it s a digi pipe dream don t fall for it,-1
thanks for spreading the word monero really should be in everyone s portfolio,1
true of meme coins and lots of alt coins but bitcoin is here to stay a little exposure to it in the portfolio as risk tolerance allows is good,1
monero is a coin with a genuine use case serving its purpose without being shilled by influencers i will keep buying in the bear market,1
ask tech people what they think of blockchain the vast majority of experts in both technology and finance recognize crypto is a scam but hey a few excar salesmen and ceos that routinely get in trouble with the sec for securities fraud they know what they re talking about right,-1
yeah that could be a correct statement though that this sub has the worst analysis but except analysis bitcoin has a real value over the crypto currency and people thus love it no matter how much percentage it gets down,1
algo is one of the best and should be top,1
luna return of the scam,-1
you can check ousd out too looks great with a moderate return,1
just shows that there are still a ton of degenerate gamblers in the space,-1
yea a big jump off the edge of a cliff,-1
it wo nt going to go down forever we all can believe that,1
btc has no legitimate competition it s building a highly secure store of value ethereum is amazing but there are countless layer s nipping at its heels btc is gold while ethereum is the internet the problem is there are countless additional internets that want a piece,1
tether is also backed by not much more than hope and prayers,-1
i m super bullish on dot my best hold imho love the team love the tech and the ecosystem is growing at a nice pace for instance i ve been tinkering with parallel finance lately and i really like it i think we re going to see great things from polkadot in the future good luck to all dot holders out there,1
because there is no intrinsic value it doesn t produce anything,-1
ltc for cheap and fast exchange transfers,1
prices are low but crypto is nt going away,1
literally crashing to zero in real time atm luna will be worth less than ust,-1
whenever i feel stupid and incapable of doing anything in life i just take a look into the crypto space lol,-1
cause you are still pegging btc to the dollar when actually bitcoin bitcoin while c after inflation,1
this is the way until the ride back up go outside enjoy a hobby and keep onnnn buyin we ll be wishing for the cheap days like these soon enough,1
i think it s more that we re surprised to see people leaping at the chance to get fleeced again,-1
stay away from luna scam,-1
the entire market has been receding and red last few weeksmonths load up,1
ethereum is the future people fud because they missed the boat or want to buy in cheap,1
honestly after reading this post and many of the responses i have to conclude most of the cryptospace is totally fucked the consept of crypto has been entirely lost waves of noobs arrive on crypto island and instead of revelling in the freedom do everything they can to plan their way to get back off of the island,-1
elon was the reason doge was on a perpetual dip since his snl appearance,-1
bitcoin used to be an interesting tech prototype for a digital currency when that failed because it was too volatile and slow to be useful its bagholders rebranded it as digital gold to try and dump their bags now as an investment bitcoin is functionally identical to a ponzi scheme,-1
is it zero if not then its over valued,-1
it s always best to buy bitcoin now rather than wait too long and get left behind by a spike,1
safemoon is nt safe,-1
a lot has changed actually there s hundreds of crypto coins now and they re all competitive with each other most do more or less the same thing with a different name that s a huge dilution of the customer pool on top of that given that there are sports arenas named after crypto and multiple super bowl ads it s likely that crypto has reached nearly every possible customer so i wouldn t expect much future growth of the userbase and the vast majority of customers are looking for investment returns which have not been good lately that s not great for customer retention on top of that running the miners exchanges and ad campaigns are an enormous ongoing cost that customers need to cover in perpetuity without some huge growth in the user base it s hard to imagine things will get better from here,-1
the time to get in is always the present but be safe that is never invest more than you can afford to lose and always do your own research,1
followed by an even larger dip,-1
it s a good time to dca into btc and btc only,1
k incoming get ready boys,1
spending cryptocurrency is nonsensical,-1
yep this is the time to accumulate the big guys it s all btc and eth for me for a while,1
ada is awful this post is cope,-1
this is the way seriously i tell everyone do nt try to time it just dollar cost average into crypto with your spare money and do that for years literally just do it for years and then look back and see how you did and i think you will be pleased,1
dogecoin down to b though everything s going down but some a lot more than others,-1
crypto currencies of them are pure garbage discussion according to coin market cap there are cryptos out on the world market although coin gecko shows still that s a shitload no wonder some of my non crypto friends think crypto is simply a penny stock market those of us in the space know some project have very good intentions and fail some succeed some just hang out but so many others are pure scam and we all know it i guess that is the price of decentralization and i sometimes struggle with this we do nt believe in censorship so why would we be in the business of telling new projects they are nt allowed because we are already too many in the room sadly too many people will invest their life in dumb things like squid game tokens only to find no liquidity when trying to cash out others will simply be rug pulled the worse part is the hit we as investors and believers of fundamentals take as it creates a bad reputation and gives crypto a terrible image if politicians and regulators should have a beef with anything about crypto its these shady scam projects but how to determine a shady scam project until it is officially a scam many people in the crypto world still say shib for example is a scam and that s their opinion many people not in crypto say bitcoin is a scam many bitcoiners say ethereum is a scam and so on so where do we go from here one critique politicians often use is crypto ca nt police itself when it comes to these scams and rug pulls so they need harsh and strict regulation to be enforced and penalized how can crypto police itself when project tribes ca nt stand each other and all they do is throw each other trash on twitter my hope is that in time as more and more people come in there are better educational tools for noobs to be aware of what is a fire hazard but i am not optimistic people will do what they want to do in hopes of hitting a moon shot and some shady scammers know this so i imagine that number i typed in the title will likely reach or by the time is over,-1
crypto is a fad crypto underlying value is zero and it relies on greater fool theory to grow you can get lucky while the bubble is growing but most people who are getting into crypto now will loose money,-1
i ll buy another bucks worth,1
will you be worried when eth is at why would anyone buy crypto right now if you think that we will stay at or that this is the bottom boy o boy how long have you been in crypto honest question,-1
bitcoin is better than stocks the profitability of bitcoin compared to these stocks is much higher,1
fan of cardano too i strongly believe in the future for cardano ca nt wait to have smart contracts deployed and sundaeswap,1
its a failed stable coin project which removed the stable coin and tried relaunching obviously its going to,-1
people are using btc all over the world every day it doesn t matter if of it is held as an investment there s a ton more transactions than there were before btc is used as intended it s used freely and getting more popular by the day,1
i keep telling everybody every single day of the week that polygon and ethereum are a match made in heaven nothing is going to be stopping this duo mass adoption is coming slowly but surely,1
this is why i love the bitcoin community it s not just about fiat i hope i ll be around and alive one day when people will say how much is that in satoshis not bothering in converting into state fiat,1
i bought at the ico at per coin hold everything and sold it months ago and it helped me to buy a bigger house,1
the funny thing is that people have already added more liquidity you can see on algo explorer that folks have already put some money in to your shid coin unless those are other wallets you re associated with which is to say case in point people will buy even if it s labeled very clearly on the packaging and smells very much like,-1
it always works so that s good,1
wow tron copied eth and is now copying tfl s folly tron was labeled as a coin by coinsider on yt the founder of tron likes to steal ideas looks like he stole the wrong one this time whoever triggered ust s death spiral can also trigger one for usdd i am also predicting noncollateralized stable coins will be banned eventually,-1
i m long on btc in general because there is a lot of institutional money in it now there s been less retail investors but there s a lot of big finance money in btc and crypto in general that i don t think it will completely go to if i had a lot of liquid cash i would splash on some altcoins at really low value and hold for the next yrs,1
i did nt sell luna my dollars worth now,-1
xlm works really well for exchange transfers,1
nooooo it can t be i was told it was a hedge against inflation everyone said it was the best store of value at this rate all some people will be able to afford with their btc are some pretty tulips,-1
i believe my opinion on crypto can be summed up most effectively with a simple lol no,-1
it can drop another,-1
beating inflation with bitcoin,1
renewable energy s already being used to mine btc and even without using renewable energy its been proven that banks consume more energy than btc in a year,1
the hype narrative of crypto constantly changes based on what the promoters need to push they basically repeated the phrase over and over similar to propaganda first it was a medium exchange then they found out it was too slow and costly to be a medium of exchange then it was an anonymous currency governments came up with ways to track it and required exchanges to record info about their customers then it was an uncorrelated asset that did nt work out because it is highly correlated to the nasdaq now it is digital gold a store of value and an inflation hedge that is nt panning out either i do nt think anyone is surprised,-1
i love me some ada,1
well it failed at its original purpose so people have attempted to assign other properties to it over the years current narrative is inflation hedge but i guess it may be time to put that one to bed,-1
bullish on big boys coming into crypto,1
the developers and ecosystem of eth make it the one for me it just seems like the community of eth will not let it fail and it s very easily adaptable,1
fuck do kwon and his version,-1
i don t care for monero and privacy coins as i think they represent an easy way for human traffickers to operate under the radar,-1
the lower it goes the more i buy,1
yes that s why cryptos prey on mostly poor financially illiterate people,-1
bitcoin offers billions of people around the world who don t have access to bank account a way to store spend and grow their wealth over time as i gains adoption it will become less volatile due to the larger market cap and trading volume if you look around the world today and don t think there is a huge need for decentralized and incorruptible money then i m sure we disagree on a lot more then just btc,1
the blockchain can t even work correctly,-1
its digital tulips fertilized by massive amounts of bullshit,-1
this is a huge step for crypto in germany congrats germans hope the rest of the eu follows this soon,1
what is dead may never die bitcoin has been declared dead like times it always comes back,1
wow really why supporting a scam,-1
in bear market is where money is made i will continue to dca to the assets i believe,1
luna is a scam too the guy is a dark degen swindler who is still trying to loot the public for a nd time the governance and vesting schedule of luna has fine print a parachute for vc s and do kwon himself he will make money to the bank again as he skins people alive the second time do not fall into his trap it s a gambler s den and compromised judgement due to incurred loss will only make you take more irrational risks that is nt good for the mind or the soul the gig is over cut your losses like a diseased limb live out with pride that you survived the loss lessons are expensive in life but if you are learning or trying to help people all that effort that never be considered waste because you are giving yourself or the more unfortunate people in the world around you a second chance for exchanges any tokens to them are just like the flow of the river they assume no risk if the underlying economics is bad and only interested in fees as they sell garbage to willing buyers at the current market price which is never fair ever because it is subject to change fixing or manipulation that s how markets are made it s a wealth redistribution scheme and at its worst is printing money out of thin air,-1
i am holding some paxg purely as it normally goes up when the rest goes down it is good to diversify your portfolio with commodities you can get interest on paxg i m getting interest at nexo,1
i dont see why you would not sell your luna righ now people got a chance to sell at instead of so obviously they will take it,-1
i think it s smart to hold both if you are still buying altcoins at the moment i guess cosmos is the smart buy since it recently got ravaged by lunaust and already had a lower market cap than dot not financial advice despite appearing to be exactly that,1
i will never give up in crypto again i will be grateful for the boring down times going forward veterans mantras,1
setting higher highs since january going down since november we re holding up way better than the stock market plus if we get a good catalyst we could be green ytd soon,1

this constitutioncan only end in despotismwhen the people shall become so corrupted as to need despotic government being incapable of any other b franklin bitcoin is our one chance to sperate money and state if you re reading this you are the resistance do nt fuck it up,1
not a store of value not a currency not a hedge against money printer what is it i just want to understand current understanding aside from lowest effort ponzi scam but truly i am at loss to understand and explain what function does bitcoin solve or is solving because its also carbon negative toxic because coal mines are now running some mining operations and that sounds positively awful and very much seems like bitcoin is digital cigarette blowing fumes to plebs while letting easy cheap energy sources become stronghold for even more authoritarian rules russia kazakhstan etc so what do you think is the point of bitcoin aside from speculative bubble it looks like elaborate tulip mania the longer we dont answer them,-1
i don t think shib is going to work much longer tbh,-1
to be honest that sounds extremely unrealistic litecoin has steadily lost ranks the past few years i would be very very surprised if they could reverse this trend,-1
honestly people who support this coin are tashcans the whole discord of cdc has people constantly talking about luna crypto in some weird times right now,-1
the entire crypto space is just full of morons tbh,-1
thismachinegreenscom bitcoin mining consumes energy and produces zero emissions from an energy perspective there is no difference between a bitcoin miner and any other server in a datacenter christmas lights consume energy and produce zero emissions also some people choose to mine bitcoin in the same way some people choose to put up christmas lights every year christmas lights consume more energy than the entire bitcoin network but we do nt read articles about environmental concern around christmas lights,1
i hate this crypto garbage i made a post about paying anyone btc for convincing me about cryptos usefulness lo an behold i have come to realise that the coins i had for past few years are actually not there imagine my surprise i loaded into my jaxx wallet a few years ago just because why not well thankfull it was only because ofcourse i lost it my wallet is stuck on initializing whatever that means and i cant do anything never has a bank just lost my money like that crypto is the biggest fucking scam in the universe get out of it while you still can update ok so winzupdatee showed me how to fix my crap assbitcoin and as promised i sent him btc as well as my fav answer from previous post dispite not being convinced so to whoever said i wasnt going to pay up i forgive you also this experience has only reinforced my distrust of crypto i paid almost ten dollars to transfer like thats a fee lol how the hell can anyone advocate for a service that takes more fees than private lender banks for interest yea i get it you can anonymously send money anywhere instantly but apart from this dumb excercise on reddit i cant fathom any reason or use for this especially not a store of value all civil and polite discussions are appreciated,-1
it has a huge amount of developers and in use everywhere,1
well he s an idiot crypto is going to keep going down as the dollar goes up this time next year it ll be at k a coin,-1
if terra does nt have the algorithmic stablecoin then it s literally completely useless and you d have to be a moron to buy some you are aware that the algorithmic stablecoin is of the value proposal of terra,-1
people do nt want to accept that crypto is a seriously risky and speculative asset arguably one of the most speculative because there is absolutely metrics that set a floor on the price there are no revenue there is no eps there are no buildings or machines or ip that have a hard value there is nothing to weigh and look at to say holy fuck this is very undervalued right now i should buy the only thing propping up crypto prices is feels and all this money is coming out of the same bucket because crypto is nt a closed loop meaning you do nt get paid in crypto and transact in crypto directly you have to buy it with fiat and when you buy something with it the vendor then has to exchange it back to fiat for it to have any real use for them because its not a medium of exchange excepton the very razors edge of the margin as the economy gets worse and prices keep going up people simply have less money so you are going to have a lot more sellers than buyers willing to put their fiat into the riskiest of assets when they have to pay more for food and gas and might lose their job soon this is what happens every downturn people flee risky speculative assets its going to get worse we have nt really seen any layoffs yet but it s going to happen crypto is really going to take a shit when that happens because again all the money is coming from the same bucket my point is that crypto markets will never decouple from the wider financial markets that s a complete pipe dream imo,-1
good that crypto is tanking the electricty consumption and waste that is produced along side with it is immense apart from specualtion crypto has no use at all,-1
just look at safemoon it s not even speculation that the dev team are scammers it s been proven through their code and yet these people cling to the hope of getting rich haha humans are just mostly fucking stupid creatures,-1
gon na buy the dip still,1
i hope you are all stacking ethereum at these discounted prices,1
it s really sad that you can only see a coin that you do not have the right to cashing out for two years,-1
remember when the price never recovered after he did this,-1
anybody who gets scammed again from this shitty coin is dumb literally they ai nt got my trust anymore,-1
they tax real estate upkeep costs bitcoin is the absolute best way to store money ever nothing will ever outperform it long term,1
stay away from luna scam,-1
like we have seen in the past couple of days it gets manipulated by big corporations the shit out of it and i fear this is not the last time,-1
wtf are you talking about those volatile stocks were among the largest market cap they were the darlings of the pandemic companies like netflix paypal meta etc are nt your random companies they are in the s p and used to hold major shares in your common etfs these are nt some random outliers when you look at the once top performers that is not cherrypicking the people who are overleveraged in crypto are the same ones doing leverage in stocks i do nt understand why people want to single out crypto a lot of volatility comes from overleveraged trading the same suspects are driving the dump in both asset classes why deny that,1
munger believes the usd will fail in the next years since they understand how frail our current monetary system is it s madness they ca nt see the valueutility of bitcoin,1
yup still mega bullish on dots canary chain kusama also,1
which is so sad lol a lot of people will probably hold worthless amounts of luna by the time the price crashes,-1
for me bitcoin has been one of the investments of all time,1
bitcoin is many things it s compared more to the function of gold in relation to gold being the foundation and beginning of fiat fiat was created because it was easier to transact with than literally gold gold became a denominator of the value of fiat the problem is that through corruption and human error there is no longer any way to verify the supply of fiat and gold printing fiat and mixing gold with other things and bad bookkeeping then there s bitcoin imagine the same story but instead of gold fiat being backed by btc a verifiable limited infinitely divisible asset that is mined through proof of work like gold bitcoin is also easier to transact with directly compared to literal gold this is why people consider it as a possible currency if the goldfiat supply was trusted then you also would nt transact with your precious gold that s what fiat is for same with btc hold btc spend fiat truth is bitcoin is many things store of value digital energy because unusable electricity can be used to mine bitcoin transactable medium currency a collectible because it s limited and supply gets lower everytime somebody loses their btc wallet keys btc beats gold btc beats fiat its more scarce than gold easy to transfer across the world noncorruptible decentralized verifiable it s an alternative to our current fiatgold standard and the only missing component is adoption,1
btc should be in everyone s portfolio,1
should recover after zero since there will be a recovery plan in place soon,1
bitcoin is savings true savings bitcoin is also the only true pricing mechanism humanity has ever invented,1
his first company ticket monster was a major flop which was the critical reason why i never touched that dog shit,-1
honestly fuck eth it shouldnt be in the top yet,-1
huge pump is expected,1
or how about this terra was a bad investment because all cryptos operate as if they are ponzi schemes,-1
i have never stoped buying now i am buying more,1
yes it is both actually good with a ton of solutions built on top of its blockchain and it has first mover advantage being the only player who offered smart contract functionality for a while it of course has its drawbacks and limitations because duh it s had to adapt on the go think etc and the idiots who still buy it but i would nt call it weak by any means even with its stupidly expensive gas fees it s a solid solution,1
i hate dogecoin because of its fanbase discussion i had nothing against dogecoin to be honest i liked it because it was the most popular meme coin these last years and the community seemed really cool until elon musk started to talk about it at least that s why i think it became so annoying every post involving crypto in some cases not even involving it especially posts by elon musk there are these people spamming dumb shit about this doggy coin one of the most famous figures i ve noticed is matt wallece just take a look at his tweets history and you will understand what i m saying and he is just one of them i m annoyed of dogecoin because of these people how can your life be resumed by convincing people all the time that there s a crypto out there that is worth paying for edit yeah hate is a strong word i do nt hate it but i m sick of reading dogecoin everywhere,-1
that ethereum is an shitcoin,-1
nows the time to buy bitchez,1
i think ive had enough of advice from this sub luna was nail in the coffin,-1
bitcoin being vague about its purpose has been its biggest problem originally just meant to be a cash system then it became a store of value digital gold a hedge against inflation now people are trying to think of ways to attach nfts or use it for other purposes ks mortgage assets id verification i just want a digital currency that people spend not some goddamn capitalist religious icon,-1
usdt only potential scam big enough to demolish all of crypto,-1
now s a good time to start following the news reflecting on what happen and how we got here and learning about how bitcoin could be better if your values and opinions align then ye accumulating bitcoin slowly at lows is a very good idea,1
the pump before the dump,-1
if demand for bitcoin goes up it logically starts replacing fiat currencies more and maybe one day its global reserve,1
if going long term btc and eth are the coins to buy imo,1
i d say dot is a worthy investment as well,1
not to mention the bitcoin devsusersminers trinity keeping each other in check something pos coins do nt have only users obeying the devs,1
i ll never restake anything with fixed terms lesson learned,-1
if going long term btc and eth are the coins to buy imo,1
you know that for every sale there s a buyer right buy the fear sell the greed i wish i could dca out the way i dca in,1
bitcoin is an absolute piece of shit slow outdated technology,-1
if they re staked coins at the very least start swapping your passive rewards for btc at the very very least but realistically all paths lead to bitcoin it s only a matter of time,1
every coin outside of bitcoin and ethereum was invented solely to make its creators rich why would this one be any different,-1
buy now thank later,1
the exchanges were so irresponsible to list these tokens luna should ve been allowed to die,-1
easy one solana down times this year avax has been down other chains crash under a fraction of eth volume is eth perfect no but the best so far yes,1
if you think bitcoin s less volatile than cash you re delusional,-1
pricewise i think it s a good time to get into lrc good luck,1
you just described a pyramid scheme,-1
if you buy luna you deserve to be in financial ruin these guys are pure fraudsters,-1
btc eth ltc algo solid starting place,1
this is crypto it s a wild ride no highs no lows only doge just hodl,1
time to get more ada,1
weekends are usually when it dips so while it drops we shop,1
step axs etc all these are obvious ponzi schemes so their days are numbered and moons i hope this moon thing dies it increased shitposting to an unbearable level,-1
come on now nobody could have known a scheme where someone says give me your dollars and i ve give you a magic bean that returns a year would nt go on forever,-1
every altcoin is a scam you re not diversifying you re a victim,-1
i just started playing with it but it seems great so far i also love the idea of getting their coin before it s listed anywhere i believe it can do great,1
technologically best is not a great standard whatever blockchain you identify as best tech can just be literally copied or forked and the new chain with track record is equally technically good having said that best for what there are different blockchains that have some feature that distinguishes them from the rest and if that feature is the standard they d be the best should everybody abandon whatever the top blockchain is every time a new project comes out that is better eth is good it was the first to do what it does has a large number of qualified developers and lots of nodes as you say cheaper faster etc blockchains are now out there but what s that to all the dapps built on eth there s a lot of inertia and human effort tied up in eth smart contracts and what if another new generation comes out next year even faster smarter cheaper etc or should we go with ls or chains crosscompatible with other chains or focus on bridges in the end eths value has a lot to do with being first it has a track record millions have found it reliable hackers have had at it legal jurisdictions have tolerated it any clone has a lesser track record people are more inclined to trust such a blockchain than something shiny and new where they d have to research the premine and inflation and developers and see if there are any new vulnerabilities that snuck into the code bitcoin for money and ethereum for computing do pretty good against the basic requirements for money or computing people like using what everybody uses other chains may end up displacing btc and eth but thousands have tried and failed it wo nt be simply because something with better tech speed etc came along,1
it will go to m for sure so now is the best time to invest usdt in bitcoin guys do nt miss it we are all still early,1
doge will go back up again soon,1
eth has largest and most active community of developers and that matters the most you can have the best tech in the world and it will be worthless if there are no devs using it,1
crypto is very high risk investment and i would nt reccomend it to anybody there is hundreds of crypto created for sole purpose of attractic investors who will pump it and devs or people promoting will just cash out leaving everybody else in the loss there is no reason at all for crypto going up but plenty of opportunities to get burned,-1
it is inevitable and now it is the best time to buy more crypto,1
at this pace he will own of the coins and they will worth nothing,-1
take note that you are asking for financial advice and none of us are experts if you follow any advice is your decision at the end of the day btc and eth is always a good bet i like algo and one too,1
if avalanche can continue to build and bring on partnerships they will remain in the the top for a while they have a very smart team and i think they will continue to do very well,1
you got caught up in the news narrative crypto is a lot better then a ton of other things for the environment that they do nt attack,1
no why you ask do kwon stole k btc and causes all his retail investors to lose all their money then he ignores community for burn and creates a new shitty coin and you re going to buy that,-1
i m holding axax i predict by,1
i like the original digital gold you know bitcoin,1
what s worse is that was nt the first post on how to make a shit coin it s like the third or fourth and the shit coin creation posts prior also pumped,-1
it s not just eth there s a ton of alts built on it and they all suffer from crazy fees,-1
low cost liquidity no physical storage risk easily moveable the biggest benefit interest at nexo,1
dca is only reason i do nt care if price drops anymore just getting more for less i ll take it,1
lol this crash revealed terra algorithm does not work when luna crash like that btc should at least drop at certain level did the team use a single btc for backing up it s a joke,-1
of crypto projects are scams,-1
you got ta think a few years out with cro it s still early,1
that s literally what crypto is a ponzi,-1
ethereum will be the biggest letdown in crypto history,-1
dogecoin is one of the fastest cryptos and with some of the cheapest crypto fees now if i want to send money from america to my friend in india by westernunion it is and takes day if i send dogecoin it s cents and max minutes,1
ethereum gas fees are too high to make it worth using,-1
this is why i m bullish on ethereum even if l projects won t be built ethereum they still rely on it as an l for both its infrastructure and security i don t think eth going anywhere anytime soon,1
it s going to dump you smooth brain,-1
grab it while it s on sale lads that s me thinking,1
no other chain is as distributed and decentralised as bitcoin this is what it does best,1
was unlocked for developers this dude is scamming again,-1
the record we did nt need,-1
everyone who ever would ve invested in doge already has done so there s no longer any bigger fools left who will buy a useless currency it s going down to dollars trust me,-1
you can use it as actual currency a hell of a lot more places now than you could then,1
this is probably a more popular opinion but monero is criminally underrated and not spoken about enough,1
the problem though is a lot of people do nt think cryptos are riskier than stocks i see so much rhetoric about how bitcoin and similar is only going to go up and easily x over the coming years it unfortunately seems to be the less informed educated about investing that have just seen the influencers on tiktok youtube reddit etc they see this as their ticket to riches and you will be kicking yourself in years time if you do nt take advantage now if you try and speak to them rationally to think through what they are saying they just shout that it s fud and ignore it most cryptos are net negative the only value in them is what people put in minus the fees the people running the platforms miners dev wallets founders selling excess tokens etc are taking out so it s impossible for every investor to get back the money they put in there will always be someone left holding the bag,-1
it s going on sale i m gon na get so fat on bitcoin that when i sell it people are going to call me a whale,1
good time to accumulate,1
there is only one wise answer bitcoin,1
think the hype gone now we stuck holding bags,-1
you can accumulate at even better prices next week and the week after,1
a great way to bring money in to help ukraine,1
no one has convinced me that crypto as an investment is anything other than a ponzi scheme i can see the utility of it as a currency i do nt think it s great as that either the question i ask is what about the useful features supports the current price,-1
i thought it was a store of value where d the value go btc does nothing now,-1
i got banned fro crossposting to this sub you know you have a sound investment when you have to frantically ban and silence anyone that is even remotely negative of it meanwhile constantly having to find new buyers or you lose money,-1
ethereum is a scam scams are off topic in this subreddit,-1
basically how the ponzi falls sure luna has had a decent ecosystem but the arrogance of the founder coupled with several factors just make this an investment red flag,-1
lightning network has the capability to do millions of btc transactions a sec with near to fees,1
crypto as a whole needs a win i m rooting for a smooth transition,1
you are correct people say bitcoin is too expensive it s too late they are wrong in bitcoin is at million per,1
btc should be in everyone s portfolio,1
hahaha i think the entire crypto industry is a dangerous destructive scam run by idiots for the benefit of idiots at the cost of other idiots believe me i m defending nothing the idea is laughable but anyone who thinks false advertising is a reasonable way to pursue remedy against anyone here is out of their gourd,-1
i could nt imagine being one of the suckers who bought into luna,-1
you do nt understand bitcoin true bitcoiners will never sell it for fiat also major lol calling fiat actual money if you knew what money really was you would understand bitcoin is the realest and hardest form of money our planet has ever seen,1
so many scams hard to covert money back to fiat relentless junk and fake emails nft hype stupid jpgs and celebrities exploiting the space so many shit coins so many pump and dumps use cases mostly bullshit great community mostly bullshit and in my opinion preys on those who seek a community to be involved with whilst unknowingly having their pants pulled down horrendous fees to do literally anything with crypto still so complicated to deal with and risks of accidentally losing your money hodling diamond hands rockets etc market manipulation just like the stock market unregulated ok if that s even really true is that so great see above re scams using fiat remains by far easier and more secure and last but not least just losing money unless you re lucky to have been actually early you are no longer early or strike on a pump and dump early and get out at the right time i am willing to hold until i break even and i am then getting the hell out if i can even get my sodding money somewhere i can use it after paying the tax man handsomely of course,-1
seriously i feel like i m taking crazy pills here but how is this not apparent to everyone and before cryptobros come out of the woodwork and say that i do nt understand crypto i read the original whitepaper maybe a year or so after it came out and have kept reasonably well informed on crypto stuff since then early days bitcoin was kind of interesting but it pretty quickly became apparent that it could never function as a consumer currency if bitcoin attempted to process even of the transactions that amex does in a day it would take weeks to verify a transaction so if it ca nt be used a a currency wtf is it people started pointing out that gold is largely worthless except as an agreed store of value so they said well ca nt bitcoin be that no of course it ca nt gold has physical substance and the backing of nation states it s value is protected by legal and social institutions yeah all money is fake but bitcoin is the fakest of all at the end of the day all crypto is worthless until you can find someone to trade you actual fiat currency for it because it ca nt be used to fucking buy anything that means that all crypto is just a bagholder scam it works as long as the next idiot comes along to hold the bag fundamentally it is no different from the holofoil comic book covers that almost destroyed the comics industry in the speculative bubble of the s except there s a level of exposure the size of a small western european country no party lasts forever every bubble bursts time is a flat fucking circle,-1
xlm is going to do great this year,1

glorified ponzi scheme that wastes people s time and electricity,-1
gusd seems pretty safe as gemini is probably the exchange that follows the most rules it s only apy but i would nt be worried about losing any money i put in to it,1
i d love to see cryptocurrency regulated out of existence it s a black plague on humanity literally it s a carbon producing monster that we desperately need to crush we also need to stop a lot of the other carbon producing industries too like oil and gas but unfortunately our world can t function super well without gasoil right now but we can function without cryptocurrency and have been for thousands of years it s literally called being patient and waiting another day or two for funds to settle not to mention cryptocurrency is absolutely filled with scams and the technology blockchain is outdated and stupid literally a unchangeable linked list any programmer worth their salt can see that it s basically useless old technology it has some very tiny niche uses which largely most corporations and governments don t need it and certainly they don t need a cryptocurrency maybe one day it won t exist anymore i can dream,-1
it s perfect morning to shop buy the fucking dip folks,1
i do not feel sorry for anyone who got into ponzikwon ii,-1
xlm having a relatively stable price is a good thing it makes it a better currency than most other cryptocurrencies,1

we can no longer trust central banks and governments the internet has connected everyone thus allowing us to see through the bullshit we need a decentralized currency for everyone,1
i ve posted this before but regulation particularly around stablecoins would be so good for crypto we are nt going to see widespread adoption until there is more regulation in place and a safer playground for more risk averse people and institutions to live within this can live in harmony with crypto as it is today this of course does assume that the regulations are done intelligently which is definitely not a given but i do think it has a solid chance of happening there s enough money in crypto with folks like the winklevii and armstrong that will push the regulation in the right direction,1
i think it can be very dependable if you pick the right stablecoin and manage risk accordingly generally the higher the yield the higher the risk,1
bitcoin is the first player in the decentralized crypto market and that s why it is good for people to use it but there are also many other options along with it,1
bear market is over nothing but green candles from here on out,1

it is solving the need for digital cash and the potential loss of control of the global reserve currency either gold or bitcoin will become the global reserve currency in such a situation the warning of it happening has been there since having a bit of bitcoin and some gold is just good risk management in case that eventuates plan for the worst and hope for the best is my motto if you would rather plan for the best and hope for the best then good luck to you if things turn to shit,1

people trash on xlm but i think it is here for the long term and beyond,1
i think shib is great,1
ethereum is good and not just because it has the first mover advantage it has managed to sustain a community of other projects built around it which is actually genius sure the gas fees are a pain and l might actually be accomplished way down the line but this does nt negate its abilityprogress or how good a project it really is to be nd to bitcoin is no small fit if it were litecoin and ripple will be where it is today my advise stack as much eth as you can the market is wobbly now for sure but guess what it s still early days and it is you who stacks that s the beneficiary of that first movers advantage being discussed at rpbtonline we share a lot of insights about the markets and how you can stack ether eth learn and stack as much as you can while you can cheers,1
funny how people think bitcoin s risk is comparable to stocks a lot of these crypto investors are gon na learn the hard way sooner or later,-1

bitcoin is a hedge against bank bailouts its literally in the genisis block bitcoin is a hedge against the entire financial system from central banks to commercial banks of people will not buy bitcoin to hedge run away inflation but of people will buy bitcoin when their bank collapses their credit card stops working and their grocery store accepts lightning payments,1

bitcoin is just negative energy it ll never produce a dividend i don t think it s a safe heaven if the dollar collapses i want an asset that doesn t require an internet connection retail investors with stimulus checks stack bitcoin governments stack gold i see bitcoinblockchain as an amazing service but it s not an asset ups is valuable because of its shipping services not because an envelope is worth k if i want to use bitcoin to transfer i d just buy worth and transfer it idk i just don t see the value in it,-1
it s a store of value and a hedge big investors trade it like the stock market so that s why it goes up and down with the other markets it s still early it takes a long time for these things to come to fruition as people are so resistant to change,1
stop supporting this garbage,-1
good time to accumulate,1
