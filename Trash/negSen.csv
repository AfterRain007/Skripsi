Even last year during the pandemic when I saw my portfolio tank, I left work disheartened but went home and threw a couple grand into it at 4700 and then tried to forget about it. This time? I bought at 49 and then saw it dip a bit and then got out when it went up to 51-ish when it was clear it was going to peter out for the weekend. I didn’t fomo at 37, 35 or even 31. In fact, this is the FIRST time I haven’t fomo’d. It can go to 45 and I won’t buy. My fomo broke. I think the Elon bullshit just kind of got to me. I loved Bitcoin when it felt like it was ours. Now it feels like it is some toy for the billionaires to play with. I dunno. I ask my friends what they are doing and same deal. It’s a wait and see thing.

389,"Yeah, I think we agree. Bitcoin holders are in it for selfish reasons as most people are in most facets of life. I couldn’t say exactly how many are in it to take advantage of Bitcoin’s strengths vs pure speculation. But my observation is that those that hold more and longer take those qualities more seriously because, like any long-term investment, you want to understand and believe in the fundamentals. 

I think that Crypto loans are handled similar to Billionaires getting loans against their stock options. There are plenty of lenders willing to offer attractive rates to lend against even volatile assets. If the LTV drops below a certain percentage it’s the borrower’s responsibility to increase collateral. Ostensibly the borrower has enough faith that the asset will increase over the life of the loan that 1) they won’t have to put up more collateral and 2) the increase in the asset will be worth enough more that they can just refinance and effectively retain the same equity.

I think this is several years off for Bitcoin holders due to volatility but you brought up the question of use case if no one ever spends it, that’s one possibility. Digital real estate. Owning a chunk of Amazon doesn’t have any intrinsic value for the lender except for the confidence that it can be exchanged for money. (Obviously Amazon does productive things, but the lender doesn’t care about that beyond the values of the equity) In a hypothetical case where 100% of Bitcoin is being held and there is no exchange at all I could still see it retaining its value because of the other relative strengths. (There are other problems with that hypothetical post block reward, as miners would have no incentive to Mike with no transaction fees, but just taking it to an extreme to address the topic.)",0

After a bit more digging I came across this post: [https://www.reddit.com/r/ledgerwallet/comments/7nxjax/derivation\_path\_for\_bitcoin\_segwit/](https://www.reddit.com/r/ledgerwallet/comments/7nxjax/derivation_path_for_bitcoin_segwit/)

In it I saw this written by r/Guy_Tell (Thanks btw lol):  To access your other accounts, you need to update your derivation path accordingly. For your account #2, the path is m/49/0/1, for account #3 it's m/49/0/2, etc. Hope it helps, cheers. 

So I created new wallets on Electrum each time changing from the default of m/84'/0'/0' to m/84'/0'/1' then m/84'/0'/2' etc.

578,"> Lightning's biggest flaw is that either party can remove all funds from a shared wallet. Elizabeth Stark (the main Lightning dev) admits this when she said ""I get all of her funds too as a penalty"". All you have to do to steal the coins is not sign a previously agreed upon transaction and then broadcast this on-chain calling the claim fraudulent (even if it was legitimate) and you'll be awarded all the coins.

""Lightning's fundamental technology is a local two­-party consensus, known as a payment channel. Two parties send an initial amount of Bitcoin into a multisignature transaction with a local consensus on the current balance allocated between the two participants. Updates to the allocation of the current balance can be made only with the cooperation of both parties, using a new transaction which spends from the funds allocated to the multisignature transaction to each party.

One on-­blockchain transaction is made to deposit the funds into a multisignature output. Before this transaction is made, a refund transaction is created, which returns the original deposit to both parties. After the transaction is broadcast on-­chain, the payment channel is open and ready for transfers. When one wishes to update the balance with a new balance, both parties must consent to the new balance and generate a new spend from the transaction. In effect, they have created numerous ""double spends"" from an on-­blockchain transaction, but have elected not to broadcast the spend until either party wants to redeem their funds on­-chain.

These multisignature transactions are real Bitcoin transactions. Either party may broadcast the most recent transaction, the current local consensus state, to the global blockchain at any time to redeem their current balance of funds. As either party may redeem funds from this channel at any time unilaterally, without requiring any cooperation from anyone else, the most recent transaction is effectively their current balance in the channel. They may continue updating the channel with updated states without interacting with the global blockchain until they wish to close out the channel. In other words, updating the local consensus state is actionable on the global consensus state.

Updating the local transaction state is enforceable via mutual revocation of old states. When balances are updated in a channel, the prior state is invalidated via a penalty system. Only the
most recent balance state should be broadcast, which spends from the on-­chain multisignature output. If either party incorrectly broadcasts an old transaction state, the counterparty may take all the funds in the channel as a penalty. As a result, both parties have a direct economic incentive to only broadcast the most recent transaction state. This is achieved by having an on-­chain dispute mediation window before the funds can be dispersed. The global consensus state, the Bitcoin blockchain, becomes a dispute resolution system for off­-chain local consensusstates. Similar to how the vast majority of legal contracts are adhered to without going to court,
the balances in the channel are agreed upon in the off­chain local consensus state, and have the option of on-­chain programmatic enforcement. 

The innovation of the Lightning Network is the use of time­locked transactions and cryptographic nonces to allow many two­-party payment channels to form a connected network where payments can be sent over many channels without trusting the intermediate nodes. The topology is similar to IP networks like the internet: packets are routed over many physical links, and the communicating end nodes don't worry about the route as long as data gets to the destination. This works via a decrementing time­lock that permits every intermediate node along the routing path to accept funds only if they forward it along to the next participant, using disclosure of preimages of cryptographic hashes. In the Lightning Network, nodes are not able to seize funds traveling through their channels even if they fail to forward payments or refuse to perform any actions. A node operates without custody of third party funds, which is enforced by a time­limited cryptographic script. This is all achieved off­-chain assuming cooperative parties, and enforced on­-chain when one's counterparty is not cooperative.""

> As for an exaggerated benefit, it doesn't currently fix scaling issues. If we want the world to adopt lightning it's going to take 40+ years just for everyone to have a single channel opened on the blockchain. That means we need channel factories (another layer) but that means another 2+ years of development.

Opening a channel is a transaction. Let's suppose that a fully optimized block (SegWit, etc.) can contain about 12,000 transactions. That would be 12,000*6*24*365= 631 million transactions per year. One for every human would be ~14 years, assuming modest population growth. During that time we can expect blocks to grow to contain more transactions as well, although that should only happen after the block are fully optimized and the maximum number of transactions are consistently moved off-chain to LN or other L2 networks.

> Another down side is that lightning may not even happen, according to Elizabeth Stark (Lightning's main developer) lightning will be released on 14th June 2016 at the latest. Did that happen? All their promises that it'll be soon fall flat so I've personally lost hope.

It's being tested now on mainnet. It's still ""beta"", but then again, so is Bitcoin. Production LN will be fairly common in the next few months.

I know that you can't wait for NFTs. Luckily they do exist if you really need them now.

1136,"To be honest, I'm not much of a trader myself. I've done 2 trades last week, both netting me 1k each. Everyday I spend my morning watching the charts, trying to find an entry point. I haven't tried doing any trades this week as I don't know how to play the market during a correction. I only enter a trade when I feel almost 100% confident I know where the price is heading.

I understand that feeling of missing out, I've missed quite a few opportunities this week and the last trade I made I could have netted 3k but I got greedy and the trend reversed on me. I think the best thing to do and probably the only thing you can do for this, is to try and find something that you can learn from your mistakes. It's better to be overly-cautious and miss out on trades than to take unnecessary risks and lose money. You could also try paper-trading and find a strategy that works out for you the majority of times.

As for support and resistance, I don't do this sort of work myself. There's a [youtuber](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCN2WmKUchJpIcS1MupY-BuA) that I watch that does very accurate technical analysis. He does daily livestreams and goes over numerous markets - equities, crypto, metals, futures, forex.

1238,"Well actually ..
>One or two speakers touched on Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. Let me first say that we are not observing a systemically relevant holding of digital currencies by supervised institutions – by banks, in other words. Actually, the credit institutions established in the European Union are showing a limited appetite for digital currencies like Bitcoin, notwithstanding the high level of public interest. However, recent developments, such as the listing of Bitcoin futures contracts by US exchanges, could lead European banks too to hold positions in Bitcoin, and therefore we will certainly look at that.
However, we should understand that Bitcoin and other digital currencies are in the unregulated space and should be regarded as very risky assets. Virtual currencies are subject to high volatility and **their prices are entirely speculative**. Banks should measure the risk of any holdings of digital currencies in their portfolio accordingly. Right now, digital currencies are not subject to a specific supervisory approach. Work is under way in the Single Supervisory Mechanism to identify potential prudential risks that these digital assets could pose to supervised institutions.

1529,"You have to sell some with the mindset that you won't buy back in without buying it at a lower price. 

If you buy some you have hold it until it's at a higher price.

Assign a % of your portfolio as trading stack (mine is like 10%) and a % as a HODL stack

You have to be happy with both scenario's
So if I sell at 36k, and the price goes to 40k - Awesome, 90% of my money made more money. If it goes down - Awesome, I get to buy some more at a lower price!

You walk into the rocket and take one look back at the Earth, outside the launch site you can see the masses squabbling over various other vehicles. You make out a huge hoard cheering around a giant train in the shape of a dog. You shake your head and board.  
  
Soon as the last of the old money boards the doors shut and the rocket takes off. Its going stratospheric leaving the earth behind it.

It’s going to be controlled by the same people that most people think they loath and despise. Bitcoins are simply going to become just another stock that is traded in the open market.

Time locked wallets, not letting people dump right away. Giving time to observe potential value increase.

Why even try something crazy like that?  If we believe that its gonna 2x or 10x, it must come through increased network effect. Strengthening network by introducing new participants could be way to boost adoption.  Also potential reward would be disproportionally larger than needed investment.   Like donating 1% of holdings to targeted population and making it 10 x twice as soon.

Who would be the lucky, chosen ones to get this gift? Totally up to bitcoin holders to reach consensus. 

It could be people in population who are closest to median wealth. Like small business owners. People likely to generate much greater wealth if given some economic boost.",1

1. As you say, there is no way a central bank is going to create a digital currency they can't control;
2. Are governments willing to break the back of the private banking system? If the answer is no, then they would need to create a two-tier distribution system to avoid disintermediating banks.

And those two things alone would make their eDollars much less attractive than bitcoin, while retaining bitcoin's competitive advantage and reason to exist. But I still think they're more likely to try that vs an outright bitcoin ban.",0

3331,"I'm only tossing this out there because there seems to be a lot of fear and I want to present a contrarian perspective. As always, don't forget: if you haven't sold, you haven't lost anything because 1BTC is still 1BTC.

I am comfortable with USD/BTC exchange rates at these levels and am buying (DCA) starting today and running 7-10 days or so. The BTC/USD exchange rate may go down a little more, but I believe that this correction is still just shaking out the overly-exuberant speculators. There is a real 'user' base reflected in the BTC market cap: folks who are actually buying BTC as a savings account because they don't have access to traditional banking services or are using it for payments because they don't have access to a more stable/useable currency. My firm estimates that 'users' component of the BTC market cap, with an added $10B of hard-core HODL'rs to be about $100B. Based on a circulation of 14.7m BTC, we think $6-7k USD/BTC should be a floor based on fundamentals (to the extent we ultimately know what the full set of fundamental KPI are), and dips below this point represent over-correction.

This isn't investing advice and you always have to make up your own mind about how and when to invest. If you believe that BTC is facing new opportunities because it has made/is making significant technical advances (SegWit, Lightning fees/Tx times falling) or market advances (more potential users with accounts, consumer mind-share, regulatory progress, major new entrants like Samsung) that aren't priced in yet, you should look toward the end of this year for some solid growth above the current valuation. We believe that there will be more users as the year progresses and more legitimate service providers/retailers supporting Bitcoin as an option. If you also believe this and you don't need your investment back immediately, selling now only locks in losses. If you believe that BTC will dip further and want to take a risk on buying back in at the absolute bottom before the bounce, you can certainly try. Timing those things is really, really hard.

The halving has been coming in faster than every four years due to the ever increasing hash rate producing blocks on average something like every 9m30s instead of every 10m00s.  Because of this, we've now gotten to the point where the halving is before November, but that's just due to the continual increase in hashrate.",0

If a situation occurred where 30% of the hash power went down then it could be two weeks of 30%+ slower block times until it recalculates to make it easier.

Psychologically speaking some people are like baby fawns in the woods who flee at the faintest rustle of leaves. So they sell because they think bitcoin and the world are about to end. That's all.

I've got a basic understanding of the mechanics but all the deep level code stuff doesn't really interest me, more the high level big picture stuff.

3814,"Remember, there are still people that have never heard about #Bitcoin.

3815,"How it happened is a question that only you can answer, but the history of that wallet looks as follows:  
1) on 2013-12-06 there was **one** transaction sending 0.4BTC **into** the address.  
2) on 2013-12-18 there was **one** transaction moving 0.35BTC **out** of the address, leaving behind the remainder of 0.0499BTC.  
3) on 2013-12-24 there was **one** transaction sending ~0.036BTC **into** the address, giving us the current balance of 0.086686BTC in that address. It shows 3 ""input"" addresses because those 0.036BTC came from those three addresses (looks this way because the sender didn't have enough in one address, so their wallet used multiple) 

So to clarify: On blockchain.info one arrow equals one transaction, green arrow means it goes into that address, red arrow goes out of that address.

Speculation:  
you created the paper wallet and filled it in step 1, changed your mind in step 2 and decided to refill the wallet in step 3. The full correct story is probably somewhere in your brain :)  

If you have further questions feel free to ask.",1

3845,"When you look at the chart for an alt coin that has been pumped and dumped it usually has a rapidly occurring high, then a drop, then a second run up that doesn't go quite as high as the first, then a gradual downward trajectory until, if the coin has any value at all and isn't just a shitcoin, it levels off somewhere above the point where the pump and dump started. This higher leveling off could be attributed to higher awareness of the coin brought about by the meteoric rise. Looking at the BTC chart back to November or so it looks the same, like BTC has been pumped and dumped. My casual non expert prediction is that BTC will level off in the 8-10k range then slowly grow, with spikes up or down based on positive or negative events.",0

5113,"> Any combination of the 12 or 24 words is a valid wallet I believe.

For practical purposes that is true.

The maximum value of a valid seed is a number slightly less than 2^256.  So if you pick a random number between 0 and 2^256, there is a possibility of picking a number so close to 2^256 that it is not a valid seed.  The likelihood of this happening is so vanishingly small that it is not possible to recreate this event in testing.

With a 24 word seed, the maximum possible value is slightly larger than 2^256, so there is a possibility of generating a number that is too big, in which case you just discard it and try again.",0

5536,"> Return on investment (ROI) is an approximate measure of an investment's profitability. ROI is calculated by subtracting the initial cost of the investment from its final value, then dividing this new number by the cost of the investment, and finally, multiplying it by 100. 

Example: Bob buys $100 of Bitcoin.  After one year his Bitcoin stack is worth $108.  Bob's ROI is 8 percent, not 108 percent.  

After 10 years, Bob's initial stack is worth $278K.  Bob is quite pleased.  Bob wants to know his average ROI over the ten years.

R = $278000 / $100 = 2780  

X^10 = 2780  

log( X^10 ) = log( 2780)  

10 * log( X ) = log( 2780 )  

log( X ) = log( 2780 ) / 10  

exp(log(X)) = exp(log(2780/10)  

X = exp(log(2780/10), or about 2.21

*Note: X is not the ROI, rather X^10 = (final_value / initial_cost)*  

2.21^10 =$278K / $100

Bob's long term average ROI is X - 1, or 121 percent per year.  *But don't just take my word for it.*  Use a calculator, a spreadsheet, a short computer program, or paper and pencil: Start with 100.  Increase it by 121% ten times.  

For example:  

>>>  
>>> a = 100  
>>> for x in range(0,10):  
...   a += (a *1.21)  
...  
>>> a

Yeah kinda, but I also busted my ass because coming from a working class family meant I had zero safety net when I finished university (I received grants from the university my family is that low income).   


Get some decent employable skills, or if you already have them then learn to sell yourself to employers. Work your arse off to self-teach yourself outside of work, and secure a stable career with a decent salary. Ball out for a bit on your newly acquired income, and then hunker down and live a frugal life.

Yet the crypto currency craze appears to share some commonalities with the great Tulip Bulb Bubble in the 1600s. In contrast to some of the more hyperbolic claims:  
  
\- Crypto is not a stable store of wealth with 6x the volatility of US equities and 18x the volatility of the US dollar  
\- Crypto is not an inflation hedge, or a hedge against the much higher interest rates that accompany elevated core inflation. In fact, crypto appears to be an equity risk proxy, and is highly correlated with stocks  
\- Crypto is not being used as a widespread medium of exchange, and its adoption as such is being blanket banned by numerous nation states. Western countries may ultimately regulate it out of existence  
\- As a non-income producing asset, the value of crypto relies on its efficacy as a store of wealth and a medium of exchange, both of which are being called into question  
\- Future demand for crypto is likely to be undermined by the return of materially positive interest rates on risk-free cash deposits, which will dramatically increase the opportunity cost of switching into crypto

The peak at that time was around 1k so they will be up 300-???! % . I dont have to explain what most will do once they get their coins back after all these years

Imagine you shipped me a €1 milion worth of goods from the US when $1 was 1€, but it arrived now. Should I pay taxes from the value of the goods when it was ordered, paid, shipped or when arrived? If I use a conversion rate, can I chose the best one I can find? (fraud anyone?). All of this was happening daily between any given 2 European countries.

However, if 2 EU companies make business on a bitcoin standard, the Euro will cause friction it used to remove before.

So waiting for a $500 drop in BTC saved you $5. Probably not worth it.

6426,"Is that possible? Absolutely. Is it probable? I certainly don't think so because there are a couple of situations that would make that happen. The first one is people in droves losing interest. That's not happening. The news is actually very positive. Searches are starting to trickle up again. I think a lot of the people who got burned in January are going to be very hesitant but what is going to kill these people a second time is they are going to sit on the sidelines and wait and watch and when things start going again and increasing they are going to start to fomo in after we have already had a substantial price rise. When we take it out $20,000 you will see people come out of the woodwork. I have no idea how high we are going to go on the next cycle but I think a million is very optimistic. 40 to 50000 is what I would call a low Target and 100,000 is what I would call a high Target. If you look at all of the run-ups we have had since 2009 the percentage increase keeps shrinking as the dollar amount keeps increasing. 

2020 is when the next Bitcoin halving happens. After that event takes place you're going to have half the amount of new coins on the market everyday. That is going to create a scarce vacuum as the months go on just like it has in the past",1

Same for buying, I didn't realize that at first I would buy like $10 here $10 there and I was losing $1 every time.

The biggest thing is that people almost always fail to see potential until it is realized. So when I feel I see a glimpse of potential I invest. It's worked out great for me so far (fingers crossed).

More so my logic is the old saying of, prepare for the worst, hope for the best. I'm fully preparing for things to get bad. Maybe not full society collapse. Maybe more so major economic collapse that would be worse than the 1929 depression. I don't believe it's going to be like, apocalyptic level with no power, no food, no water, full out every person for themselves, full on civil war. But I do expect it to get way worse than what my grandparents had to deal with during the depression. I don't think afterwards the US government will be the same.

**Limit Orders**

 - A limit buy means someone has told the exchange to buy bitcoin for them when the price drops to $X.
 - A limit sell means someone told an exchange to automatically sell their bitcoin when the price reaches $Y.
 - **Limit orders *do not guarantee* that your entire order will be filled.** Even if you set a limit order for 1 cent above or below the current price, it's possible it never gets filled (if the price never hits that number again)
 - Limit orders generally have less/no fees
 - People who make limit orders are called ""makers"".
 - Limit orders are displayed on the order book. 
- On GDAX, the order book is displayed on the left hand side, you can view it in increments varying from $0.01 to $10.00 (the +/- at the bottom)
- The greens are limit buys and the reds are limit sells. 
- This is visually displayed with the depth chart in the middle of the UI (in between your orders/fills and the price graph). This is where you see buy/sell walls (tall vertical lines indicating a large amount of bitcoin to be sold/bought).

**Market Orders**

 - A market buy means someone has told the exchange to buy $X amount of bitcoin, even if the price moves while fulfilling that order (this is called slippage).
 - A market sell means someone has told the exchange to sell $Y amount of bitcoin, even if the price moves. 
 - **Market orders are *guaranteed* to fill your entire order.** If you want $1000 of bitcoin, you're getting $1000 of bitcoin. 
 - The people who make market orders are called ""takers"". 
 - Takers on GDAX are charged 0.25% fees on every transaction (this % goes all the way down to 0.1% if you trade a significant volume over time).
 - **The price moves when someone burns through all of the current limit buys/sells, depending on which way the price is going.**

**Stop Orders**

- These are essentially market orders that are triggered after a certain price is met.
- These are generally used by traders to ensure that they don't miss out on big swings in price.
- A buy *stop* set at, say $1000, for 1 BTC, would mean that someone puts in a market buy for 1 BTC as soon as the price hits 1 cent above $1000.
- A stop *sell* is the same thing, but the opposite direction: when the price dips below a certain point, the exchange would sell the specified amount of bitcoin.
- Stop orders are guaranteed to fill the entire order unless they are stop limit orders. This essentially is a market order with a limit on the price. If enough slippage occurs during the market order, the limit kicks in and the whole order isn't filled. This could've been very useful for some people who made market buys at, say, $9000 when the price dipped this past week. If they wanted to only buy at $9000 and not at $8900 (because maybe they believe bitcoin will crash if it dips below $8900) then they'd set a stop limit buy at $9000 with the limit at $8900.
- **Stop orders are not displayed on the order book.**
- Stop orders can cause a big price spike/dip because they'll chew through the order book very quickly right after large, round numbers. 

**An example of how a market buy would push the price up by burning through limit sells:**

 - Say the current price is $100. 
 - There is 1 bitcoin at a limit sell for $100. 
 - The next offer is 1 at $200. 
 - The next offer is 1 at $400. 
 - If you place a market buy for $600, you get:
   1. the first bitcoin at $100
   2. the second at $200
   3. and 0.75 bitcoins at $400 (you pay $300 for it, $300/$400 is 0.75 bitcoins)
 - you now own 2.75 bitcoins and the current bitcoin price is now $400 with 0.25 bitcoins being offered at $400.

The sell walls (or buy walls, just swap sell with buy and up with down here) just means there's a huge amount of BTC to be sold at a certain price. Usually at round numbers, it can get up to hundreds of bitcoins. Since the price doesn't move until all these orders are filled, sell walls essentially stop the price from moving up until every single one has been completely sold. 

Let me know if that helps. I may have abused the bold/italics in there but hopefully it's pretty readable.

Also if anyone finds any errors please let me know.",0

If you buy for one month let's say 8,900 then the following month you buy at an average of 7,000. When that next pump happens and it jumps back to 8,900 or higher than your already making a profit. I look at is as a savings acct. A very risky one at that. You should have your safe one in a bank, 401k, etc and also have a small side one of crypto. In time it will grow, especially if you keep pumping Fiat into your wallet. It won't hurt and one day you will be surprised how much you've ammassed. It also is an addictive way to put money away and makes you want to save more in life. ",-1

8011,"This is not about cheap oil or cheap energy. Negative oil is not just cheap, it’s insane and doesn’t make sense. Oil is a symptom of a global economy that is imploding. If you look at the historical charts, especially recently, the oil market prices have foreshadowed what is coming for the stock markets, and other markets in general. And once this happens people will panic and flee to a safe haven, which for now is the US dollar. Gold is starting to show strength as well but it may go down with everything else short term.

Hard to call here for Bitcoin. On the one hand BTC has been mirroring the stock market recently. On the other hand, people eventually will wake up and realize that a trillion dollars is now being printed weekly. The problem with this is that most people (98 percent plus) know next to nothing about crypto or trust it. Likely once the dust settles and more information comes out, then adoption may be accelerated significantly.

Many institutions that are selling all their profits from an over inflated stock market are likely waiting to buy in at rock bottom prices
For crypto then hype it up once the dust settles and make a lot of money. A lot more legit institutions have been buying crypto quietly and that can be backed up by several sources.",-1

8088,"It looks like transaction fees have doubled in the past two days. In December alone they have gone from a reasonable $5 average, to now, nearly $40.

Source: https://bitcoinfees.info/

I do actually see this as a problem. That is a significant increase happening very quickly, and looking back historically of the charts, it is fastest spike in fees BTC has ever had and the highest fee. Given the trend, it may actually go higher in the coming days. We might actually see a $100 transaction fee average by New Years.

/u/starkbot is going to be on Bloomberg later and I'm hoping she is able to give a realistic timeframe for relief of this. 

Looking at the spike on the chart, I am actually a little concerned.

Every user who wants to make a transaction announces their intent across the network. Each miner keeps some list of all the pending transactions they've heard and fills their own block with all the highest fee transactions.

Then they guess random numbers until they produce a hash with the required amount of zeros and announce they have completed a block to the rest of the network. Everyone else accepts this block, drops what they were working on and starts the process again? So at any given time everyone is 'mining' completely unique blocks?

8462,"Sorry I completely misread your comment, you’re talking about volume, the daily volume of bitcoins being traded has a lot to do with day traders who can trade multiple bitcoins back and forth multiple times per day. 

Look into bitmex, they offer leveraged trading which inflates daily volume by a lot. 100 dollars with 100X leverage on bitmex could get me a whole bitcoin, but if the price moved just one percent down while I’m holding my leveraged position I’d lose the entire principle and my position would be liquidated. I’d definitely do some research on leveraged trading, I tried it, it’s super risky and I actually lost money but I’d suspect that’s where most of the daily volume is coming from. 

Over the long term though, like 4 years, miners have sold millions of BTC, that number will only decrease going into the future and its highly likely that the overall demand will increase, day traders will still day trade but likely with less bitcoin, so I’d expect volume to go down over the next ten years and into the future as eventually all bitcoin makes its way into the hands of a hodler.",0

You do come off as someone who knows what they are talking about. But as others here have said, looking back at the charts, if you did in fact buy Bitcoin, every year you'd be positive by just hodling/holding. Two years later and it's still at 8k? Sure. Why not. Let's say you're right... But 10 years from now? I doubt it. And it'll be hard for it to just crash back to 8k if it reached 50k. Something big would have to happen.

> Most institutional investors will not buy Bitcoin at rock bottom but at a more convincing bottom than $5900 (once the $6000 BTC resistance is broken, a new hell will break loose and the whales will be directing that crash course).

Institutional investors are there to make money. 2K, 6K, 10K... it doesn't matter. For those who have access to billions, those prices are peanuts.

But there's one thing institutional investors like, and it's assurances. They like to make sure they will get their profit, one way or another. This is where Bitcoin still could fail.

I agree with you in the sense that Whalers will control the next crash, but in my opinion, the whalers are the institutional investors. In my opinion, they are already in the market, making money and moving their pieces into key places of this massive crypto-game. 

Why am I certain of this? Ask yourself. If institutional investors likes assurances, wouldn't they want to have control of the game? They will do what they have been doing in every market. Controlling it. 

Bitcoin is a scarce currency right? Control a large piece of the currency, and you will control the direction of the market. 

HODLER's don't control shit. They are out of the market. They have no influence on the bitcoin market value. Yes, some of them will probably get rich, but not that many.

> From that point on, Bitcoin will soar to new highs $60k/BTC and a crypto market in the trillions. 

Billions would need to enter the market for that and institutional investors are not there to inject value. They are there to profit. To take value out of the market.


>  I made about $6K last night.

My guess - and a few other people have commented much the same - is it is a whale (or whales) who have a price they don't think BTC will drop below, and who are in effect DCA'ing low-margin longs against that price. If so, someone is pretty confident that the price is gonna go back up.

FWIW, this is my strategy at the moment, DCA with fiat and extend my margin to match (but, relatively speaking, on a microbial scale).",0

9921,"I think a lot of people's disappointment in Bitcoin stems from the assumption that it was guaranteed it would go up. If it was always generally going up, then surely it will always go up. If it hit $20K then surely it will hit $20K again. It's not necessarily gonna work like that. Even if it succeeds in its adoption.

In the world of investment, nothing is guaranteed. The second you think you have something figured out, is the second it will do the exact opposite of what you were expecting.

Bitcoin itself is not a guaranteed thing yet. There's no mass adoption yet, and the general public is still very cautious and a bit fearful of it, and they've now had a decade to jump on board. Plus if they eventually embrace cryptocurrency, who's to say they won't embrace another crypto? They might seek something faster and cheaper, or a better alternative might pop up along the way in the next year. Nobody knows for sure. I personally love Bitcoin and the tech, but who's to say everyone else will see things the same way I do.

Even if Bitcoin gets adopted, it's not guaranteed the price is gonna ""moon"". It's a possibility, but there's a lot of other possible scenarios. Remember how the introduction of futures contracts created this counter-force to the price of Bitcoin. With mass adoption, you may also see an increase of counter forces, maybe some put in place on purpose to keep Bitcoin more stable and more useful so the price doesn't fluctuate. Since mass adoption is more likely to work with a more stable price, in order for Bitcoin to succeed, it may have to stop shooting up and fluctuate wildly, and not ""moon"". 

Just keep your mind open to other possible scenarios, so you don't get surprised, and most of all don't get burned when it doesn't go your way. This is by no means meant to be bearish talk. I'm still a believer in Bitcoin. You can be hopeful and bullish, and still keep an open mind about bearish possibilities. ",1

Coinbase came close but then randomly decided to put a hold on my funds for 12 days. Gemini is confusing, I bought bitcoin but can’t seem to spend it there either.

All I want to do is buy a small amount of bitcoin and send it to a specified address to pay for a service, preferably using iOS. Any app recommendations, useful resources, or tips would be greatly appreciated!",-1

10249,"No, no, listen: If BTC only appreciated in USD proportionally to the diminishing value of USD then you'd be correct.  But that's not what's happening, or what will happen. Not even close.  As USD loses value, legions of individuals and institutions across the planet need places to put their wealth to avoid the erosion.  This massive demand outweighs the limited supply of BTC and in order to fulfill that demand the price must go up.  This 'going up' is by orders of magnitude more than the inflation of USD that is causing it.  And inflation is only part of what makes Bitcoin attractive, it's not the whole reason for buying, just one of them.  Also Bitcoin is young, its true value is still being explored and only a very tiny minority have stumbled upon it. Someday, years from now when all the assets are properly valued your analysis might be closer to being correct, but imo we're nowhere near that day.

10265,"You can lab this idea inside of virtualbox and pass through the external drive to VM. If you want to put this into production......

A) Firewall appliance that will partition your network so you can keep the server to itself without the unnecessary devices adding to the chatter on the subnet. There are two very faithful virtualization environments - UNRAID and PROXMOX. I am currently using in production but I feel like PROXMOX comes with more stability though it requires a min $80 a year to get their enterprise updates BUT you get their freeware and its alright. UNRAID is slackware based and is a 1 time purchase. I use UNRAID only as a personal VPS solution, but it appears to be quite stable and just runs. 

If you wanna go 100% free virtualization production then installing debian and controlling your VE farm through it is fine enough. The other two solutions have awesome point and click web interfaces and they are purpose built so you get tons of stability if you need an uptime guarantee. 

&#x200B;

B) Basically all of the above but rather than a firewall appliance, you can get a rack computer with multiple NICs and then virtualize a firewall OS such as PFSense or OPNSense. This requires further understanding of networking as since the box is also its own firewall, more security measures should be put in place. 

&#x200B;

I think the benefit of a virtualization environment will be that you could house multiple ledger node types under 1 box OR multiple bitcoin nodes pointed at different places - PERSONAL COIN TUMBLER???

I haven't gone that far with these concepts because of time constraints - the personal coin tumbler is a very interesting idea I just came up with while typing this and could be achieved with a botnet style solution such as Ansible or something personally scripted to control x-amount of wallet instances piped through different darknet addresses.",0

Doesn't this remaining room for price discovery just encourage continued speculation and holding versus widespread adoption (which makes it difficult to find the actual stable valuation?)

This doesn's mean the bubble isn't good for yet another bull trap this year. It doesn's even mean the last bull trap is over. 

Of course, I might be totally wrong. But this is my honest opinion.

It’s a feedback loop - if only few businesses price things in fiat, less people want to have fiat, and then the prices in that fiat become even more unstable. That’s why failing countries deteriorate into hyperinflation very quickly when they detach their currency from the USD and the Euro - and their population switches to USD even for internal commerce.",-1

10858,"I get it, the electric energy consumption is an issue indirectly, but I disagree with the assertion that bitcoin mining itself is dirty.  Electric energy consumption itself is not dirty, that's why we're moving to electric cars after all.  How the electricity is generated can be an issue depending on how it's done so why don't we tackle the heart of the problem itself by pushing for more renewable and clean energy?

Nobody was concerned about energy consumption when Amazon, Microsoft, Facebook, Google, Netflix, and countless others built datacenters around the world to power the internet & cloud age were they?

Do people express concern about electric energy consumption caused by hollywood and tv studios producing, filming, editing and distributing their content?  I used to work on set and I can tell you there's nothing energy efficient about it.

The main reason why some people are measuring bitcoin against a standard that they don't hold to other industries is because they don't believe in the value it can bring to the world so in their mind it's all a waste anyway.  And they take pleasure in shitting on it.  This is why the energy FUD is disingenuous.

All Bill Maher could talk about was investing mania but he didn't even make the effort to take a step outside of his own bubble to consider how a sound monetary solution like bitcoin is already being used as a currency in places around the world that have experienced hyperinflation.

11082,"Lol, what a pessimist. There is huge amount of FUD to load. There are 195 countries in the world, so you can load sht tone of FUD (thing is small countries FUD is not important, big numbers playing big role).

So far crypto friendly (more or less) countries:

[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legality\_of\_bitcoin\_by\_country\_or\_territory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legality_of_bitcoin_by_country_or_territory)

From the largest countries with unfriendly face to cryptos you can exclude Russia as a FUD source. Russia is irrelevant in crypto currency context. They can blow thier faces off by pompous retorics and screw thier own ppl, but they can't do sht about crypto prices. Not as much ppl there, and 99% are poor as goats. And institutioanl investors are too late to share the pie. They will just take whatever is left later on. And stupidity of the governemtn will make this ""later"" as late as possible, so they get almost nothing.

Dont exclude US treasury from the list of unfriendly faces. Though, at some point these idiots will understand, that they'd better invested in cryptos to make most profits on it. Polititians sponsored by corporations will bend the govts sooner than later (that is how it works in US anyways). **That said, we would still have the opportunity to buy up the dips and make profits on them.**

Anyways, the largest economies of the world are at least not against crypto (some are already pro-crypto, such as Japan, EU) and with new generation of politicians that might turn thier contiries in full pro-crypto.

All the rest will submit or to bigger economies anyways.",0

11263,"You forget. All the profit on the way up can be diversified to other investments. The alternate strategy could also be to strait hold all the way up if you don't want to diversify. But yes this is the way to beat the market for any asset. Infact, a trick can be used to save yourself from failing assets. If one asset fails find its parallel counterpart that is successful. Then move the money there keeping the same levels. So if a Dapp crypto fails but another one succeeds, Move the funds and keep the levels following the process as if you were trading the other asset. **I assume the 50% is what you are willing to risk... not your net worth...** The amount you risk may be 1/50th of your net worth so 50% to start would be 1/100th of your net worth. You can diversify the rest using a similar mechanic. **With this method... Volatility beats the market. Trending follows the market.** If you don't believe me test a bot. The reverse of this strategy. You will lose to the market real quick.

The concept behind this is maximizing how much asset you have not how much USD you have expecting that when prices stabilize having more land, Btc, stock is worth more than a $$ number which fluctuates. Using this method on land you would probably only hold, but if it did drop and you doubled your holding on land you have 2x the land. Think about that. Even if you are cash poor this process helps you buy up all the land around you and increase land ownership with every market crash. Think about owning a company. The stock market crashes 70% and now you buy 2x companies. **When it goes back up you have more asset even if less cash.** I think it is worth it in the long run. Crypto is no different except it dips more meaning more asset doubling opportunities meaning more money to be made diversifying.

&#x200B;

TLDR: Yes you can trade salami with this and probably make more with less risk if it goes up and down by 3x for 1/3 respectively or if it goes strait up or strait down eternally (Very unlikely)  just hold.

Imagine if/when Bitcoin is not seen anymore as a risky investment. More fishes are going to get into the game, and also countries. Owning just one BTC is going to be unreachable once more countries start adding BTC to them reserves. 

People call it hopium. I call it evolution. It is a matter of time.

..., if you believe they can dump it the blockchain data says otherwise. Whales dump the Bitcoins pretty often - open short positions - win the bet and then buy for cheaper. Win-win situación. This is going to happend as long as the market cap makes it easy to manipulate. At 10T market cap is going to be harder to move.

Based on the numbers he gave, the US alone would contribute $200T (obligations) * 0.1% (risk premium) or $200B to the market cap, and the other world sovereigns would, we have to assume, make up the other $1.8T through their obligations, keeping in mind they all probably have higher risk premiums than the U.S. (e.g. he says Canada is 0.4%).",0

TAKE THE HODL NOFAP PLEDGE! not frequently assessing prices

Basic pledge (aka ""HODL Weds""): Only check prices on ONCE A WEEK on Wednesdays! Hourly or daily prices fluctuate, but week over week is generally very positive. Then when you load up livecoinwatch (or whatever you use), you'll see that BIG gain every Wednesday and have a BIG grin. :D

Advanced pledges: - Real /nofap - Fap only if you reach your gains! (say ""HODL nofap BTC $20k"" for example) . Alternate: You may substitute nofap with ""nocake"" or ""nobeer"" - HODL Monthly - check only on the first Weds of the month! - HODL Annual - check only on New Year's eve!

PSA: Crypto will change the world—and it may change your life—but it shouldn't control your life or cause you stress. Go out, live your life, check back once in awhile. The longer you wait between checks, the bigger the satisfaction. I didn't check for 2 years and only broadly heard on the news that crypto was skyrocketing—then on Thanksgiving, I finally checked.

If I sell and rebuy, I end up LOSING money, keep the SAME amount of sats, and get a better buy-in.

If I BUY and keep buying through the dip, I actually DON'T lose my initial investment, GAIN more sats, and get a better buy-in.

Both methods get a better buy in, but one nets me far more sats (which are on sale) and ensures that I don't realize ANY losses.

I took the latter method, and now I have a buy-in at around 32k. And I am happy.

It is time to do the final synthesis. The monetary issue for national currencies will be more participatory and will not be controlled solely by a centralized apparatus. What matters is that fiat will better retain value by becoming a viable medium of exchange over longer time periods and a better unit of account. Bitcoin, on the other hand, is not and is not close to being a unit of account, in any way, and is really far away from being adopted as a medium of exchange because its store of value capacity increases almost exponentially. Nobody will pay anything with bitcoin, only a fool or a needy; bitcoin will be the main decentralized investment next 50-100 years. Bitcoin is not and will not be a currency, in any way, although it can be used as a medium of exchange... which kind of fool buys a hamburger with gold when he can use, on the contrary, a national currency that is worth infinitely less?

The economic system of the future is multilevel (in fact, it already is). Authoritarian governments will 1) not allow access to layer 2.0 of the economy, Blockchains, or 2) only allow the use of traceable, digital cryptographic money, not allowing paper money and forever vanishing privacy and therefore freedom. It is really extrange that all you do not understand yet that the best anonymity is cash, in hand, even if it is the worst store of current value. In terms of anonymity, Bitcoin is worse than a bank. It should be understood after 11 years. And it will be more fully understood in just a moment, when the power of AI-driven block explorer analytical companies, and government agencies, is best deployed.

BTC gains are taxable as capital gains (short or long term) once converted to USD, however, transfers to like assets do not constitute a conversion and thus are not taxable. 

With this in mind, are there any non-crypto currency (stable/conservative) like assets that you could move your BTC gains to without tax implications? Eg. Rather than sell BTC for USD to invest in a CD, stocks, or a mutual fund, can you just move BTC to another investment?",1

You have to be okay with a short term market crash (think of the real estate market in 2008, the people it effected were people who HAD to sell...people who could afford to wait it out did fine, their real estate is now worth more than it was before)

&#x200B;

It's tempting to wait for a dip or crash to buy cause then you could buy ""more"", but the reality is, if you really don't believe in it enough that you're expecting a crash/dip, then you're definitely not going to want to put money into it while it's crashing/dipping...so just buy now and forget about your investment for a few years.",-1

**Meanwhile in LA LA Land** 

- Coronavirus death toll rises to 492, 24,552 confirmed cases worldwide and 23,260 suspected cases. 900 recovered. (Coronovirus is spreading faster than Chinese claim and China hiding the real casualties)

- Over 3800 new infections. 39 new cases in Hong Kong, Macao and Taiwan

- United Airlines suspends US flights to and from Hong Kong.

- Multiple people with coronavirus on cruise ship off Yokohama, Japan; 10 people taken to hospital.

- Wuhan plans to convert another 8 existing venues, including gymnasiums, exhibition centers and sports centers, into hospitals by Feb.

- Sudan announces four of its students in China have contracted coronavirus.

- Six new cases of coronavirus confirmed in Thailand.

- First case of coronavirus in Belgium.

- South Korea reports case of coronavirus in woman who visited Thailand.

- Hong Kong confirms first coronavirus death.

- Singapore reports local coronavirus transmission among six individuals.

- Macau, the world's biggest casino hub, to close gambling industry for at least half a month.

- Number of confirmed coronavirus cases in Germany rises to twelve.

- Ten days ago most of the cities inside the Hubei lock down (besides Wuhan) hadn't reported a single case, now some are approaching 2,000.

- Hyundai will suspend production in South Korea as a virus outbreak in China has disrupted supplies of auto parts.

- The head of the Canadian virus lab in the Chinese spy scandal 'suddenly' died today. The cause of death was not reported.

- American Airlines, Cathay Pacific and Jetstar close routes to China.",-1

So, if a mortgage/loan is agreed upon and amortization is settled, it would be in terms of whatever amount of Bitcoin will equal the amount of dollars required for the monthly payment.

Bitcoin running alongside of current FIAT structure is the only way to transition to a cryptocurrency economy and that transition would take many years. The solutions to issues of the future are not created yet, so naturally we don't think about them as we will once they materialize. As an example, many perspectives of the future of media storage when CDs and DVD disks were mainstream, was that the future would be tiny disks lol! Nobody thought in terms of SSD drives and streaming!

15059,"Litecoin is fairly similar to Bitcoin.  It has the lightning network implemented, but also has a significantly lower network effect, and thus lower value than Bitcoin.  (There are people who would staunchly disagree with me and advocate for it though, recommend reading their subreddit to get a sense of what those arguments might be.)

Ethereum is very different from both BTC and LTC.  Ethereum is not trying to be the ultimate store of value like BTC.

Ethereum is different than Bitcoin in that it allows for smart contracts which can be described as highly programmable digital money. Imagine automatically sending money from one person to another but only when a certain set of conditions are met. For example an individual wants to purchase a home from another person. Traditionally there are multiple third parties involved in the exchange including lawyers and escrow agents which makes the process unnecessarily slow and expensive. With Ethereum, a piece of code could automatically transfer the home ownership to the buyer and the funds to the seller after a deal is agreed upon without needing a third party to execute on their behalf.

There are many people who are incredibly bullish on the platform potential of ETH.  There are a number of applications that currently act as a third party to connect you with others based on some set logic (e.g. Uber, Airbnb, eBay). Many of the centralized systems we use today could be built in a decentralized manner on Ethereum.",1

It's easy to look at the chart and say, I should have bought that dip, or, I was a genius for selling that peak.  But the peaks and dips are only evident in hindsight.

As I write this, the price of one bitcoin is $62,604.  Should I buy?  What if there is another Mt Gox and the price tanks below $20K and never recovers.  Should I sell?  What if Brazil adopts bitcoin as legal tender and the price soars above $100K and stays there forever.  Nobody can predict the future.

If you believe in bitcoin's long term prospects, then buy and hodl, that is the only winning strategy.  Everyone who pats themselves on the back for buying the dip or selling the peak is deluding themselves and if you try to time the market then you will get rekt sooner or later in the long term.",1

15203,"Everything you express points back to the exact same issue with your perspective - you only see how things are and refuse to be open mined. The limitations with fiat are very very simple. It has nothing to do with all these prosesses you are caught up in. You're just outlining the current system and praising how efficient it is now. Which I understand because it's natural to use the present as a measuring stick, and not the future. You almost sound like an accountant with your conservative stance. We're not here to evaluate your knowledge of how the current economy functions. I get it, you want to highlight that and I think it's great that you like to learn.

Bitcoin consolidates numerous processes within one ecosystem. Is that simple enough for you? The technology surrounding fiat is not fiat, it's third party tech. The limitation of fiat is that it will always rely on third party technology. Bitcoin comes packaged with everything needed onboard and can be scaled infinitely. It's ironic that you say I'm not close enough to the technology, when that's the exact component of bitcoin that you are neglecting to acknowledge. All the trusted third parties you refer to that are required in addition to the currency are not the middlemen I am talking about, and you know that. There will also always be a need to borrow, and there will also always be interest rates, and many other moving parts but again, this is irrelevant to the consolidated nature of bitcoin that I'm pointing out as making fiat inferior.

Stop hoping to learn anything from any crypto conversation until you're ready to acccept that bitcoin has graduated far beyond the fad stage, or the forgotten invention stage. It is here to stay and will morph and shapeshift countless times from the original satoshi whitepaper until it becomes what is the most efficient form. Don't you get it? Bitcoin can be made into exactly what we need, but fiat can only ever rely on third party tech to be improved. And that's not even involving the advantages of being global and decentralized. 

You sound like a senior who refuses to use modern tech because things work just fine the way they are. And that's your choice. You should do you, as should everyone. We're not here for a long time.",-1

15451,Alright so there are a couple of things going on here. The first one you have to be aware of or the cycles. You can see this if you look at a 10-year history of the company. Imagine an oscillator. That's how this stock trades. There is something called the Baltic dry index which in layman's terms is what they can charge for shipping. The higher that goes the higher the day rate becomes on the ships. Now if you look at the really big picture on the Baltic dry index in 2016 it bottomed at a lower level than it was trading in the 90s. During the last major cycle which was 2003 to 2009 metals and bulk shipping did really well because China was clicking off at 10% GDP every year. Same with the Emerging Markets. That all crashed along with the housing crisis and a lot of these shipping companies had ships they could not pay for and no one wanting to Charter them. You look at the earnings of a couple of the good names like DSX and ssw and you see them burning money. They were not making any profit. Now back to that Baltic dry index. If you look at 2016 until today you see that series of higher lows. Now you look at the earnings of DSX they went from losing ass loads of money to breaking even with a small profit on this last earnings report. Now you look at the share price. We had to run up to a little over $5 and now we are correcting back down. You have a company with improving earnings and a share price that hasn't really caught on yet. Where is the risk? It's in the macro. If we have a recession or if we have drastically slowing Global growth it could be a negative. However it's extremely unlikely we are going to get anywhere near 2016 levels again. A lot of the ships and over supply have been scrapped or sold. When you look at the rest of Wall Street and some of the high earnings multiples on companies that have been doing well for years I just don't really see the value. I mean people are paying 17 times earnings for Heinz. Yes like ketchup. What I'm doing in a nutshell with DSX is selling parabolic rallies and buying support. The level we are at right now I'm nibbling. I'm not 100% sure if I would say this is a bottom because we don't have any signs of it but again if we look at that chart you see that run up off of a clear double bottom. Now we have the correction. It might do a Fibonacci retracements or it might just be a regular Cup & handle retracement before the next stage takes off. What we don't want to see is the price get back down into the mid 3s. That would be full circle. If we go down to $4 flat to where we are now that is just a good healthy correction. Again the risk is macro. If we have slowing GDP into the back half of the year which is a pretty reasonable possibility it could put a limit on this particular stock but then again a nice horizontal trend is really easy to trade. If you look at the macd right now you will see the histogram trading up which is a bullish Divergence couple that in with the price action and where we are on the oscillator. It just seems like a reasonable time to accumulate a little more so I bought another hundred shares this morning and will keep watching the price action. The worst case scenario is stopping out about 3.90 or cost averaging in the whole way down and waiting for the next cycle. When China starts to accelerate again this thing could really go to town because dry bulk shipping is things like iron ore. Copper etc,-1

Every article so far claiming Bitcoin has a heavily negative carbon footprint is literally **just** looking at the energy expenditure and translating that into conventional energy impact, as if every mining rig is plugged into the country’s main grid through wall sockets.

That’s not how this works because miners need profit and the best profit comes via cheap (ideally free), renewable energy.

Your article is happy to proclaim Bitcoin uses more energy per transaction than a British home does in 2 months, but its a very disingenuous analogy, not least because it’s looking at grid use, and it’s near impossible to mine and make profit while being plugged into something like the UK’s national grid.

Seriously, we get it. You called ""bubble"" over and over until you were right, just like thousands of other armchair economists. We get that you think bitcoin is a ponzi or a pyramid scheme. We get that you think they're digital beanie babies, doomed to sit forever in someone's digital closet collecting dust. We get that you think a limited supply, decentralized, unregulated currency has no chance of ever succeeding.

So my question is - why are you still here? What are you hoping to accomplish by repeating the same arguments over and over? **We heard all the exact same shit in 2011, and here we are two years later, still trading at \~$70.** You aren't going to convince us that bitcoin is dead, or even dying, so why bother? What's your goal here? You won't rest until every poor sap has pulled all their dollars out of BTC so the world economy can get on with business as usual?

.................

Why don't you just come back in two or three years when the next bubble inevitably pops and try to convince us again? **Third time's the charm, right? Will you be using the same arguments if it reaches a high of over $1000 and crashes back to a stable $250?**",-1

16284,"Thanks for replying man. I appreciate it. I also spoke to a very intelligent person about this. He said in quotes after I sent him an article ""the first link about the new zealand banks pulling support for nzdt i don't think affects us too much.  the topics on reddit don't influence me much- i see fear / panic / blame- for example, ETN was having trouble everywhere, cryptopia or any exchange couldn't be blamed for that.  The tons and tons of people having issues with support tickets not getting answered after 3 days - they aren't paying attention to reality.  Cryptopia was an excellent exchange.  Because of their excellence they are now having tons of problems because their popularity boomed faster than they could scale up.  so the 90% of new people experiencing the issues their collective herd have impacted the website / server / customer service with are forced to form negative opinions.  Its like a million cats being pushed into a shoebox, they are all going to get scratched and angry lol"" 

yea they need a MUCH bigger team

I mean if they need help. Why don't they hire help

they are hiring, but you see, the crypto-space is a trustless system.  its too easy to invite someone with decent reputation only to  have that person reveal their true nature later on by robbing everyone.  hiring is slow, because trust must be established.  They have some of the best talent in the world, but finding reliable people who won't cheat, hack or steal is a problem.  many programmers see themselves as Gods above the law, I'm finally watching Mr. Robot so i'm really understanding the gravity of security flaws.  People simply can't be trusted like they used to back when the protestant work-ethic was more important than the get rich quick at everyone else's expense culture...",0

I could be wrong, but I think the main point is that people are still here because they see what the technology can do, and are open to helping it get there without being deterred by what isn't great right now, or in the past.

In financial markets, high-frequency trading (HFT) is a type of algorithmic trading characterized by high speeds, high turnover rates, and high order-to-trade ratios that leverages high-frequency financial data and electronic trading tools. While there is no single definition of HFT, among its key attributes are highly sophisticated algorithms, co-location, and very short-term investment horizons.  HFT can be viewed as a primary form of algorithmic trading in finance. Specifically, it is the use of sophisticated technological tools and computer algorithms to rapidly trade securities.

You have to keep track of profit/loss on every transaction, which adds a level of complexity that is impractical. I’m mentioning this, because I’m surprised to not see it discussed, and wonder what people are thinking. 

I’m generally anti-bitcoin for environmental waste reasons, so I would prefer less use anyway (less mining actually. ) But only recently started thinking about this. 

It’s kind of a weird gray area , because SEC has also exempted BTC from some securities regulation on the grounds that it’s a currency. CFTC regulates as commodity. That strikes me as very strange. 

This will also have implications even if the wasteful aspects of POW are mitigated (by off chain transaction for example. ) 

To my mind, these regulatory conflicts and ambiguities would need to be resolved for any cryptocurrency to actually be used in any significant capacity as a (legal) currency.
