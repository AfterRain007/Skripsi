I'm talking about the MONETARY VALUE of btc. 

Because currently, what we're doing is exchanging fiat for btc. Btc can still be used for the exchange of tangible products, like the examples you stated.

But what's stopping the US gov to officially and outright declare BTC an illegal currency? Imposing hefty fines/jail term on businesses big and small if they were caught transacting in BTC? Do you still think businesses would risk accepting them? It will slowly but surely fade  away the MONETARY VALUE FOR THE EXCHANGE OF PHYSICAL GOODS of btc. 

Another example, i walk into a store with a kilo of drugs/controlled substance in exchange for a van of soda. That kilo definitely has much, much, much more monetary value, but it's illegal for the business to accept it. Yes some businesses would still take it, but most won't.

In layman terms, what if the future of btc is actually just a super fancy, technologically perfect, hyped up, digital in-game currency? It has it's own value tagged to it, but not something you can live off it (monetary/wordly value). You spent years exchanging and DCA-ing fiat for it but you can't actually use it if regulations are officially imposed on a global scale.
