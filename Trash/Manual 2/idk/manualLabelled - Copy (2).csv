BTC solves a problem I've never heard major concerns over.

The best use case for crypto is drug dealers and other criminals. And that's a perfectly reasonable use case! I'm sure BTC will find a floor around $500 or $2000 or who knows where, thanks to these market participants. But other than them? Hmm.. ",-1

1039,"I'm not talking about the network at all. Networks can always go underground and i agree there's no way to stop it.

I'm talking about the MONETARY VALUE of btc. 

Because currently, what we're doing is exchanging fiat for btc. Btc can still be used for the exchange of tangible products, like the examples you stated.

But what's stopping the US gov to officially and outright declare BTC an illegal currency? Imposing hefty fines/jail term on businesses big and small if they were caught transacting in BTC? Do you still think businesses would risk accepting them? It will slowly but surely fade  away the MONETARY VALUE FOR THE EXCHANGE OF PHYSICAL GOODS of btc. 

Another example, i walk into a store with a kilo of drugs/controlled substance in exchange for a van of soda. That kilo definitely has much, much, much more monetary value, but it's illegal for the business to accept it. Yes some businesses would still take it, but most won't.

In layman terms, what if the future of btc is actually just a super fancy, technologically perfect, hyped up, digital in-game currency? It has it's own value tagged to it, but not something you can live off it (monetary/wordly value). You spent years exchanging and DCA-ing fiat for it but you can't actually use it if regulations are officially imposed on a global scale.

1169,"Yeah lol my RH account got approved like... a couple days before all that trading halt shenanigans happened. I figured I'd just use it anyway, but as I kept plopping little by little more money in it started bothering me that none of what I was ""buying"" was actually mine.

The Trezor T looks super solid, but... I don't think I can justify the price right now considering I only have a couple hundred dollars to put into crypto at the moment. I keep a pretty clean rig, plus I can just use a virtual machine if I have to enter my private key into my PC. I'll look around at some reviews, but I'm kind of leaning toward a Trezor One.

Bitcoin is neither a financial scheme, share, or property.

Bitcoin is a crypto currency.

With 15 or 40 or even 100 times leverage on a cash settled trade, it's so worth it for a whale to buy up the physical bitcoin even at a loss because of the massive leverage they will make on the cash settled contract.

But they will make money on both the physical and cash settled contract trades.....but someone could literally buy bitcoin intentionally at triple the current market price and theoretically overpay by 300% and still come out of this golden using leverage.

But they will make a profit on both, just like when the whales shorted using leverage and took profits selling physical Bitcoin.

There's not that many Bitcoin around to trade. The game theory with physically backed BTC and cash settled contracts with 25X leverage is a whole nee chapter or wealth creation. Be part of the parade or watch it go by....you can choose.

Who would have thought we would have hit $60k so quickly when bitcoin was only $3k just over a year ago. One thing I've learnt over the years is that bitcoin will suprise you when you are least expecting it. Let's see what happens. The last quarter for bitcoin is usually very good in a bull market year, and the timing is pretty good for institutions to have jumped through all the hoops they have to to get in. We also don't know what other big news is around the corner: other countries adopting it, an ETF, Twitter integrating Lightening Network, other big companies like Facebook / Amazon buying it, banks adopting it through NYDIG?

I’m a long term holder too so I don’t really care the next 48hrs.
But I am watching to see if we stay above that Feb 6th low....why would a long term holder care, because even if those of us who bought over a year are still way up I absolutely do want to see that Feb 6th support level hold, and as we all know, it’s likely that “if” we break below our Feb 6th low, the odds are it will be within the next few weeks. Every week we stay above that support level the law of permanence creeps into investors minds.

For many of us, we still have a hard time buying because we remember buying at cheaper prices. Every week this price becomes more part of what is consider the normal price and the memory of buying $2000 Bitcoin becomes  farther and farther into our memories and replaced with the new norm.

Respecting the support level of Feb 6th is a pretty big deal for me. Because if it doesn’t hold then we need to rebuild the permanence of value at the new price.

If you pull the bids then the Panic sellers keep driving the price lower. Once that is over you turn the bids back on and purchase at lower prices. Give it a few days to see what happens but right now it's pretty constructive. We made a low that was higher than the last low and rebounded pretty well off of it.

It's just that the sellers are willing to part with their BTC at a lower price than the market price for some reason.

The seller makes it go down because they are selling. Without sellers no buyer can get BTC \(bar mining it\).

Buyers cannot make the price go down \(they'll drive it up\), Sellers can.

So why a seller is selling bellow market price? or even below what they purchased it for?

the loosing sellers:

1\) Fear, they fear that BTC is going any lower and that they'll be the bagholders and no one wants to be the bagholder.

2\) Because they need money and BTC is the last of their liquidity so they have to sell/spend it at the current value even if its a loss.

3\) late comer that need the money.

The winning sellers,

1\) they've purchased those BTC at a lower price than they are selling it even it it's below current market price and they don't believe it will go any higher and don't want to be the bagholder if they feel like BTC is overevaluated.

2\) They are still selling with a profit and don't believe in any more profit and they are parting their BTC because they need the liquidity for a better performing asset whatever it might be.

3\) Long time Hodler that need the money.

I keep seeing repetitive phrases such as ‘buy the dip, whales are loading up’ or ‘sell, crypto winter is incoming’. 

NOBODY knows where the price is headed and especially not anybody spouting repetitive one liners on Reddit. 

Simple rule of investing, whether it’s Bitcoin or any other asset.... DO NOT invest with money that you need in the near future. So many people get carried away and think ‘what’s the harm, this could be the opportunity of a lifetime’. Yes, it might be.... but it could also bankrupt you.

No matter how bullish you are on Bitcoin, there is a >0% chance this thing drops a lot lower than this and never recovers to where we are today. Unlikely in my opinion, but it’s possible and anybody who says it’s not, is spilling out their hopes and dreams, not certainties.

If you realised at this point that you made a mistake and need to sell, as you need the fiat for living expenses in the coming months and can’t risk losing more, don’t feel ashamed; you made a simple mistake that thousands, if not millions before you have made and is deep routed in human psychology. Let it be a lesson, albeit a painful one, and come back to the table (if you want to) when you have spare money that you can afford to invest and not worry about.

2498,"Obviously I cannot back this with hard evidence, but my gut says it's going to require a march past the $20K line to get widespread FOMO started.  Like, a commanding break through whatever resistance there is at $20K, and hold a solid $21000 or so for a couple days or weeks.  It needs to look convincing that reaching previous ATH won't amount to just a quick wick from big money pump and dump.  People would need to get the feeling that $20K is the new floor, and they would have to be pretty convinced that there are huge gains to be had from there.

Honestly, despite the good gains and momentum we have seen over the last few months, it doesn't really look to me like the general population sees the current price as a good buy for big gains.  The read I am getting is that most people looking to get rich quick want 10x gains or more (maybe even 100x), and I'm just not sure most of those folks think it's going up 10x from here.  Perhaps from $4K or $8k, but I think notions of a 6 figure BTC in the next year or 2 are still getting dismissed pretty quickly.

At the least, we need to get past the idea that 2017 was an accident caused by Tether.",0
