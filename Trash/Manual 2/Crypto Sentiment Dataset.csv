Bitcoin DOES have an inherent value. Its inherent value stems from its distinct advantages: it is uncontrollable and easily launderable.

Bitcoin is the perfect underground currency. You can sell drugs with it. You can prostitute with it. You can sell murder with it. Bitcoins will have value, not because it has any inherent worth, but because it will be the only currency you can safely use to conduct illegal transactions.

Want BJ on the corner of FU and LAPD? Convert your dollars to bitcoins, pay in bitcoins, and presto: happy ending for you!

The value of the bitcoin will eventually be set by the flow of money through the currency in the pursuit of illicit goods. Let's say the daily illicit ""through transaction"" market is $100M. That means every day $100M worth of bitcoins are bought, used to purchase illicit goods and services, and then sold back into dollars.

proof of work mining (e.g. Bitcoin) wastes ungodly amounts of electricity (until the world is 100% renewables mining displaces more useful work and thus creates emissions) and computing capacity
proof of space is the same but for making the world a worse place by driving up storage costs for everybody
coin speculation is a massive ponzi scheme and no crypto fan acknowledges this
the e.g. bitcoin network throughput is ~dozens of qps which would merely be hilarious if it wasn't burning as much coal as Australia
just on pure waste: Bitcoin production is estimated to generate between 22 and 22.9 million metric tons of carbon dioxide emissions a year, or between the levels produced by Jordan and Sri Lanka, a 2019 study in scientific journal Joule found. (source) - ie this game is an entire additional country of environmental damage for ~no useful gain
no one has found an actual use for any of it except for online drug dealing (which requires niche coins since Bitcoin is massive distributed public ledger)
the level of market manipulation and accounting fraud by eg Tether (and now USD ""coin"" admitted lying about the backing) would normally send people to jail but has for some reason got a free pass
the clueless marketing by fanboys who only hope to enrich themselves by creating another layer to the pyramid
the endlessly stupid projects it has spawned where blockchain is seen as a solution to anything aside from the niche case of ""distributed tamper evident journal""
it has single handedly made mass international ransomware a viable business model by allowing a way to receive cash outside the banking system
the general enablement of all sorts of scams, e.g. the endless kids on this very subreddit promoting ""12% crypto savings accounts""
It isn't nearly as secure as people think it is. Any determined state actor could subvert the network.
Deflation isn't actually a good thing in a currency. It ultimately favours the wealthy who can hold and dont need to spend.
Mining (proof of stake or work) allow the wealthy to invest in mining equipment to control or dominate the market.
Ultimately, no government on earth is going to give up its monetary policy as that is a key lever of control.
essentially everyone involved at this point is just trying to hustle the next generation - any hope any of it would serve as a useful technological or financial system has gone)
the massive mis-represnetaion of how bitcoin in particular works, despite claims, it does not offer any of the following:
anonymity - the entire blockchain is public and diligently recorded on millions of nodes
distributed freedom - a small number of mining cartels control almost all the hash power and normal people use one of ten crypto currency exchanges for everything anyway
unencumbered transactions - it's comically slow and inefficient
convenient purchases - wallets are unwieldly for normal people, no reversibility
store of value - volatility is hilarious and all anyone cares about us BTC:USD
things I do like about cryptocurrency:

monero is pretty clever
ethereum smart contracts are pretty scifi
watching people learn 5000 years of history of why we have banking regulation in a single decade has been fun
there will be some massive financial catastrophes to watch that will mostly only harm people who did not read my previous list
the earlier state of every single exchange either getting robbed or exit scamming their own fanboys was quite funny in retrospect
(thx to u/TwentyCharactersShor for some extra items).

I used to just think cryptocurrency was a fun hack but a bad idea for the mainstream, but I'm now pretty convinced it should be banned purely on resource grounds, since it seems impossible to force the externalities to be addressed

It's possible that someone will invent a cryptocurrency that's efficient to a level that it's not morally reprehensible to use, but how would it take off? the existing cryptocurrency interests want bitcoin to succeed purely because they're the top of the pyramid and also selling the shovels and so now anything new has to compete aginst the real financial sector and the entrenched cryptocurrency players.",Negative,https://old.reddit.com/r/UKPersonalFinance/comments/pal5xj/whats_so_bad_about_cryptocurrency/ha5rzrr/

You also didnt mention scaling solutions in which will help along with sharding help scale Ethereums. It is false to say it has reached limit, you can build on top of Ethereum and extend its capacity.

There is a reason why Redditts is choosing to have their community points secured by Ethereum. Its high fees are a result of so many applications and users fighting for its limited blockspace.

Although fees are high now, i expect in 2-3 years once scaling solutions in mature and deliver fees will be extremely low, as users will not be Interacting with Etheruem 1, but will be using other layers for general interaction.

This is why i think ETH is going to 20-50k+in the medium term, because ppl seem to think it will be this way forever and cant look passed the immediate in short term. Because ppl who want the best security will use Ethereum and eventually theyll be able to do it at very very low cost. All while inherenting the security of Etheruem on these l2s.

It isnt zero sum, and i see other blockchains beinjg widely used due to the huge amounts in of demand for blockspace, but if Ethereum delivers and l2s all come together then the main negative and think probably keep price down and stopping growth are fixed and i see Ethereum really coming into its own esp over a 2-5 timeframe.",Positive,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/r561oe/comment/hmlaohb/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3

Crypto doesn't have any underlying assets. There's no company doing work generating profits to generate value, interest, or dividends. The value is wholly based on confidence in th value of the cryptocurrency. There's no real value or work being done to convey value.

Because of that I don't like seeing people recommend it as an investment because there's no floor in the value. There are no assets or businesses or profits to drive the value so a serious crisis in confidence could see the value fully collapse to zero.

With proper investments there's a floor, the value of the underlying assets within the companies. Shares may trade above that based on expectations of future success but there is a floor and you know that in any market crash your assets may become undervalued for a while but they exist as shares in tangible companies with tangible profits and assets.

Just look at the top 100 cryptocurrencies, how many of them are tokens on Ethereum? A majority?

Decentralization and safety. Ethereum could have lower fees by sacrificing decentralization like many other chains do, but they don't skimp on these values and in doing so they put safety first. And even if Ethereum did sacrifice decentralization it only goes so far and it is something all chains will face once users increase.

Solution to the scalability trilemma. Ethereums solution is rollups and sharding, rollups are being implemented right now and has/will drastically decrease fees, sharding will plummet them even further whenever it arrives. The future is that people don't use layer 1 on Ethereum but use the rollups on Layer 2, you can preview this by buying ETH on Crypto.com, withdrawing onto Arbitrum (still quite high fees while in beta), and use on Curve Finance, just like you would with Ethereum Layer 1 or Avalanche.",Positive,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/r561oe/comment/hml27bi/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3

Some of them do promise large returns. And the rest, while they may not directly promise it, certainly insinuate it. Chanting ""have fun staying poor"" is an indirect way of asserting that you KNOW it will go up, leaving nonholders poor. The entire ""HODL"" doctrine that's pushed is the philosophy that you WILL make large returns if you hold long enough. Don't play dumb. If it's not direct promises, it's everything short of that.

It has no intrinsic value and despite all the white papers in the world it doesn't do what it says on the tin. People who have it have it purely for convincing an idiot to pay more than they did.

I own crypto but at least I'm honest and say the reason I do it is because of the sole purpose of hoping that the money that's in other peoples pockets ends up in mine.

Bitcoin's price continues to grow at a very rapid rate, long term average. You see, there were good reasons for Bitcoin's rapid rise. Most of those reasons still exist. In fact, today there are even more good reasons than there were 10 or 5 years ago. It is reasonable to expect the long term average growth rate of Bitcoin to stay very high for the foreseeable future.

Real estate has significant holding costs (eg: taxes, maintenance, insurance, sometimes fees, interest). Real estate isn't very liquid, and it has extremely high transaction costs.

Ultimately, the price of real estate (and rents) is limited by incomes. For example, in the long run people can't pay more for mort./rent than they earn. Realistically, they might be able to afford 35 or 40 percent of their net income for ""a place to live"". Thus, real estate prices are limited by incomes, in the long run. Incomes tend to barely keep up with inflation.

Looking at long term historical data, such as Case-Shiller, for popular real estate markets, we see, in fact, that real estate prices barely track the rate of inflation, especially when the significant holding costs are properly accounted for.

Bitcoin has no such limit. Bitcoin has no holding costs. Bitcoin is liquid. Bitcoin transactions are typically very little. Bitcoin's price has been more than doubling every year, long term average, and as mentioned before, can reasonably be expected to continues its rapid ascent.

Real estate is currently in a bubble, as evidenced by the price-to-income ratios. The current bubble will pop, as the prior bubble eventually had to pop.

Real estate is nailed down. Bitcoin can be taken with you to anywhere in the world. Real estate is a sitting duck for higher taxes. Real estate can be confiscated.

When the private keys are properly stored, Bitcoin cannot be confiscated.

Knowing all this, a person would be a total idiot to purchase real estate instead of investing in Bitcoin.

Having said that, I do plan on eventually using a small fraction (about 10 or 15 percent) of my Bitcoin holdings to buy my dream home - and to pay for it with Bitcoin, but still end up sitting on a serious stack of sats.

Because it’s so immature it can be legislated to oblivion.

Also that it doesn’t have any sizeable use cases yet other than trading it and money laundering. I can’t see it becoming used as a currency as deflation inherently built into it as well as its price volatility is an impediment. Also the story of store of value is weak when you consider that its price fluctuates massively, unlike traditional assets. The only thing I can see is international payments but this will end up being done without needing any of the cryptos out there.

No matter what the narrative, I feel and believe that everyone is just holding to maximise their returns then dump their “bags” to someone else who’s hoping to do the same. As there is no underlying asset to underpin the value of the coin other than supply and demand, if demand collapses, the price will as well.

It’s open to manipulation, insider trading and so forth. These have been largely regulated out of the mature stock markets, while crypto is the Wild West right now.

It’s not diversified enough. A tracker find tracks thousands of companies while something like that doesn’t exist in the crypto sphere to provide a notion of stability. It’s like investing in a super volatile stock.

The is used to store value. To exchange for other goods. As a unit of account.

A goods or tool becomes money when it is used as money.

In a prison cigarettes becomes money when that is the goods used for money.

Different goods or tools can be better or worse money depending on the qualities it has.

There is no requirement that it has to be tangible or physical.

The requirements are that is has to do its job more or less. It has to work as a:

Store of value Means of exchange Unit of account

And to do so it has to be fungible, transportable and durable easy to verify, etc.

Bitcoin has all those properties and is designed to excel at all of them. Some say it does not store value, because it is too volatile, but bitcoin does not contain volatility, the volatility is caused by other humans. And volatility is not a problem as long as it has remained in value or increase in value between time A and time B the volatility in between does not matter at all. So far that requires could require that you hold it for more than 2-4 years but it will go down and become better and when it does it becomes even more valuable as more and more people see that it is here to stay and see that they can trust that it stores value and even increase in value.

So far it have and it seems like a given that it will continue to work and I would not bet against Bitcoin.

Gold is not bad, but today it does not work as a means of exchange for daily items and it probably can not as people will not go back from digital. Digital is superior at saving time and being verifiable.

Inflationary currencies on the other hand incentivize people to use them for goods or investments as they are actively losing value.",Negative,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/um4inc/bitcoin_tumbles_more_than_50_below_its_alltime/

If you buy 1BTC now for $30K and held for ten years - 1BTC be a lot more scarce and $30k will be worth a lot less. The same way the stock market or any asset can be a hedge against inflation. It usually counts on you selling as inflation happens not during the fallout after - crypto preformed extremely well in the last two years during the run up of the (lagging) CPI.

Ethereum is a hedge against inflation because people spend $20-80 million for its blockspace each DAY. It mints $30M in new coins which get sold each day to people who want blockspace. Next year it will mint $3M new coins each day forever after, and I'm taking the bet people will pay even more for blockspace in the future (by L2 compression protocols that batch 1000s into 1). Blockspace is finate and demand is strong, it's been a good bet to make so far.

Here's a great site to compare POW and POS Ethereum. Something like a 2000x energy reduction sometime this year.

Bitcoin mining is done on specialized hardware so the economics of that are a lot different than GPU mining, and very strongly incentivize the new development of clean power. IMO large corporations having access to ~$0 energy while selling it for a cost isn't sustainable for true decentralization but whatever, it keeps coal mines from being profitable too if the hashrate can be inexpensively high.
The argument against it usually is that it allows existing mines to stay open longer by recycling their otherwise wasted energy into BTC which means they may not go bankrupt. That's still a step in the right direction compared to flaring it all into the sky though, and that BTC can be sent somewhere that has no power to create power (like oil is used).

Every 4 years the amount of new BTC minted per block is reduced by half, and the hashrate (security/difficulty to mine) is dependant on how many miners are trying to get the one block reward. That means if your costs 20K to mine a BTC that's worth 30K today, the next halving your costs will be 20K to receive 15K of BTC, and you would be forced to stop mining or find a cheaper alternative. If the price of BTC doubles than you are safe but (despite what btc maxis think) it can't double forever. It's a non-issue because it will solve itself. Ideally the costs from people buying blockspace (crypto fees) will be drastic enough to make up for today's prehalving inflation rate, which means a ton of POW being done to earn fees - but if today miners are already making the pivot to clean energy (and not by choice) I can't imagine in ~20 years it being any easier to use coal or otherwise.

The energy argument is a global one, picking just crypto is disingenuous because most people are completely ignorant about crypto so this is what they're taught. BTC is a legitimate currency in multiple Countries, crypto is used all over the world in places that don't have banks or face real inflation (Argentina), I spend it on cards in shops with and online too, VISA is using it because it's cheaper/faster than their existing rails, so is Stripe for the same reason. Volitility means you buy at the price you deserve not the price told to you, if housing bounced up and down every 4y and you weren't forced into a $1M two bedroom home maybe you'd be okay with it?

There are real problems with crypto but none of the things you mentioned.

Ethereum has the largest and most active community of developers by a factor of 100, I would estimate. This is a massive advantage for any technology platform. It means there is great documentation, tools, APIs, and resources that make it easy to learn and build with. Got an obscure question about the feature you’re building? There’s probably some help guide, Stack Overflow post or YouTube tutorial to answer it.

And that massive developer community also makes it much easier for startups and businesses to hire engineers who already have experience (and for any new skills, again, they can often just Google the answer).

That’s probably not what you expected to hear. You likely wanted some analysis of TPS or scalability. Ethereum chose the most logical solutions for scalability: a lightweight layer 1 PoS system with sharding and excellent layer 2 options for high transaction throughput.

POLITICS
I used to think that Bitcoin Cash was a traitor and to be avoided at all costs. I thought, how can anyone trust an ecosystem if Bitcoin, the #1 coin that everyone holds and believes in ends up being dethroned? Why would anyone invest in this space if King BTC is no more? These were my thoughts in 2017 up until just the other day...



Now, I have come to terms that BCH is not just a copy and paste clone of Bitcoin. Every single Bitcoin holder on the planet received an equal amount of Bitcoin Cash because it was a forked from Bitcoin. This means that even if Bitcoin Cash became the #1 cryptocurrency, that Bitcoin holders have no one to blame but themselves if they don't own an equal portion of Bitcoin Cash... it was given to them for free! I guess the more and more I have thought about it, Bitcoin Cash is Bitcoin because it has the same previous transaction history and literally everyone holding Bitcoin received an equal amount of Bitcoin Cash, this was no money grab.

Bitcoin may or may not scale with its small blocksize. We should be thanking Bitcoin Cash for being created to give a counter argument to see if increasing the blocksize ends up being good for scalability and fees. And if it ends up being the #1 cryptocurrency because of this, who cares, everyone holding Bitcoin during the time of the fork holds an equal amount of Bitcoin Cash, and if they don't, then that is on them.



Not sure why it took me 3 years to have this epiphany, but I did and wanted to share. What are your thoughts on Bitcoin Cash?",Positive,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/i4te41/i_used_to_despise_bitcoin_cash_now_i_dont_and/

According to Coin Market cap there are 16,844 cryptos out on the world market although Coin Gecko shows 12,463. Still, that's a shitload. No wonder some of my non crypto friends think crypto is simply a penny stock market. Those of us in the space know some project have very good intentions and fail. Some succeed. Some just hang out. But so many others are pure scam and we all know it. I guess that is the price of decentralization and I sometimes struggle with this. We don't believe in censorship so why would we be in the business of telling new projects they aren't allowed because we are already too many in the room.

Sadly too many people will invest their life in dumb things like squid game tokens only to find no liquidity when trying to cash out. Others will simply be rug pulled. The worse part is the hit we as investors and believers of fundamentals take as it creates a bad reputation and gives crypto a terrible image. If politicians and regulators should have a beef with anything about crypto its these shady scam projects but how to determine a shady scam project until it is officially a scam. Many people in the crypto world still say Shib for example is a scam and that's their opinion. Many people not in crypto say Bitcoin is a scam. Many bitcoiners say ethereum is a scam and so on. So where do we go from here? One critique politicians often use is crypto can't police itself when it comes to these scams and rug pulls so they need harsh and strict regulation to be enforced and penalized. How can crypto police itself when project tribes can't stand each other and all they do is throw each other trash on twitter.

My hope is that in time as more and more people come in there are better educational tools for noobs to be aware of what is a fire hazard but I am not optimistic. People will do what they want to do in hopes of hitting a moon shot and some shady scammers know this so I imagine that number I typed in the title will likely reach 20,000 or 25,0000 by the time 2022 is over.",Negative,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/s5232l/16844_crypto_currencies_80_of_them_are_pure/

Ok so winzupdatee showed me how to fix my crap assbitcoin and as promised, I sent him 0.001btc as well as my fav answer from previous post dispite not being convinced. So to whoever said I wasnt going to pay up, I forgive you.

And all this money is coming out of the same bucket because crypto isn't a closed loop, meaning you don't get paid in crypto and transact in crypto directly, you have to buy it with fiat and when you buy something with it the vendor then has to exchange it back to fiat for it to have any real use for them because its not a medium of exchange excepton the very razors edge of the margin....

As the economy gets worse and prices keep going up people simply have less money, so you are going to have a lot more sellers than buyers willing to put their fiat into the riskiest of assets when they have to pay 50% more for food and gas and might lose their job soon.

This is what happens every downturn, people flee risky speculative assets 🤷‍♂️

Fiat was created because it was easier to transact with than literally gold. Gold became a denominator of the value of fiat. The problem is that through corruption and human error there is no longer any way to verify the supply of fiat and gold (printing fiat and mixing gold with other things and bad bookkeeping)

Then there's Bitcoin. Imagine the same story but instead of gold, fiat being backed by BTC. A verifiable, limited, infinitely divisible asset that is mined through proof of work (like gold)

Bitcoin is also easier to transact with directly compared to literal gold. This is why people consider it as a possible currency.

If the gold/fiat supply was trusted, then you also wouldn't transact with your precious gold. That's what fiat is for. Same with BTC. Hold BTC, spend fiat.

Truth is Bitcoin is many things. Store of value, digital energy (because unusable electricity can be used to mine Bitcoin) transactable medium (currency), a collectible (because it's limited and supply gets lower everytime somebody loses their BTC wallet keys)

EVERY POST involving crypto (in some cases not even involving it), especially posts by Elon Musk, there are these people spamming dumb shit about this doggy coin.

One of the most famous figures I've noticed is Matt Wallece. Just take a look at his tweets history and you will understand what I'm saying - and he is just one of them.

I'm annoyed of Dogecoin because of these people. How can your life be resumed by convincing people all the time that there's a crypto out there that is worth paying for?

Having said that, best for what? There are different blockchains that have some feature that distinguishes them from the rest, and if that feature is the standard, they'd be the best. Should everybody abandon whatever the top blockchain is every time a new project comes out that is ""better""?

ETH is good. It was the first to do what it does, has a large number of qualified developers, and lots of nodes. As you say, cheaper, faster, etc. blockchains are now out there--but what's that to all the dApps built on ETH? There's a lot of inertia and human effort tied up in ETH smart contracts. And what if another new generation comes out next year even faster, smarter, cheaper, etc? Or should we go with L2s? Or chains cross-compatible with other chains? Or focus on bridges?

In the end, ETHs value has a lot to do with being first. It has a track record. Millions have found it reliable. Hackers have had at it. Legal jurisdictions have tolerated it. Any clone has a lesser track record. People are more inclined to trust such a blockchain than something shiny and new where they'd have to research the premine and inflation and developers and see if there are any new vulnerabilities that snuck into the code.

Bitcoin for money and Ethereum for computing do pretty good against the basic requirements for money or computing. People like using what everybody uses.

CON-ARGUMENTS
I'm totally aware that this will be probably the most downvoted post in the history of this sub. But I don't care.

Algo is the most shilled coin on reddit. I am the unlucky one and took the bait and bought Algo because of the shill. I did the research and on paper everything looked great. Fast, secure, reliable. I have read a lot of articles, read whitepaper and bought Algo. But now after half a year of holding I have to say that it's really bad. And I'll tell you why. Keep in mind that I'm talking about the WHOLE ALGO ECOSYSTEM and not blockchain itself.

Dapps - like currently there are 5 or 6 daapps? This is a joke. Younger chains have hundreds of them but in algo ecosystem there are 5 or 6 dapps and they are working really bad (more about this in the next points. The chain being young is not an excuse because other chains have much more cool and usefull daaps. Algo dapps are using AVM (Algorand wirtual machine) so the adoption will be always slower and slower.

Dapps working like shit. Many of those daaps rely on a single source of truth that is Algoexplorer API. It has constant problems and because of that platforms like yieldly works like shit. November and December was horrible. There wasn't a single day without any issues.

Official wallet... Sometimes is not working. Or not working correctly. It's too dependant on Algoexporer api and AWS.

ALGO is CENTRALIZED

No rewards for running own node

Yesterday the only Algorand DEX tinyman was compromised and hacked and all liquidity pools are gone.

Horrible marketing.

No clear roadmap for 2022.

Unfulfilled promises (example? about increasing TPS)

A lot small ones like poor website (doesn't look professional) and poor communication with Algorand Foundation

The Algorand community on reddit is so toxic and blind. If the Algo price is increasing they are posting charts and yelling how awesome Algo is and the pump is incoming. When it's down they claim that it's just because of bitcoin? You get it? Algo UP - it's because algo is awesome? Algo down - because of bitcoin. They hate every other chain because only ALGORAND is the best.

Poor price action comparing to other scalable solutions.

Ok some of you may disagree with some points but most of them are straigth facts. Please research about the recent Hack and algoexplorer problems.

And before crypto-bros come out of the woodwork and say that I don't understand crypto, I read the original whitepaper maybe a year or so after it came out and have kept reasonably well informed on crypto stuff since then.

Early days bitcoin was kind of interesting but it pretty quickly became apparent that it could never function as a consumer currency. If Bitcoin attempted to process even 1% of the transactions that AMEX does in a day it would take weeks to verify a transaction. So if it can't be used a a currency WTF is it? People started pointing out that gold is largely worthless except as an agreed store of value so they said 'well can't Bitcoin be that?' No, of course it can't. Gold has physical substance and the backing of nation states, it's value is protected by legal and social institutions. Yeah, all money is fake but Bitcoin is the fakest of all.

At the end of the day all crypto is worthless until you can find someone to trade you actual fiat currency for it, because it can't be used to fucking buy anything! That means that all crypto is just a 'bagholder' scam it works as long as the next idiot comes along to hold the bag.

PERSPECTIVE
Banks suck but crypto aint much better. Higly speculative and unstable. Just as much bullshit as there is on wallstreet. Leverage, shorting, futures, longs, market manipulation and what not. People gambling with their money.

Your keys arn't really safe, what do you want to do, implement a chip in your arm? What if the chip breaks? Keep it digitally somewhere? Dig a hole in the ground? Most people keep it on centralised exchanges anyway. What if you die, it won't go to your relatives?

It fucks with your mental and emotional state too, because of the unstable nature of it. One day you think you have money, the next day 20% is gone. People who buy early are basicly just taking other peoples investment when they sell. Call it pyramid games. The space is flooding with scammers, annoying shilling shouting idiots and and what not.

Bitcoin and the likes are highly energy inefficient. Yes but look at the regular financial systems energy use you will say, blah blah....this is like saying u can dump your plastic in the river because there's a plastic soup already in the ocean. Yes here and there they use solar panels...well why not use them for more usefull things as they are costly to make. Yes but proof of stake you will say, yes...it's basicly being kept in the air by people that are again....gambling with their money. All these company's, can't they just build stuff without thousands of people throwing their money at them, hoping they will get rich temselves.

Blockchains are cool in their decentralised way, but all the speculation on top of it...

While everyone is shouting at digital coins, society remains a shithole. Salaries are low for most people, housing prices are still going through the roof. Crypto won't safe us. Wealthy people will get more wealthy at the cost of others, and some might get lucky..the lucky few who are in it early and take other peoples money when they finally cash out.

Sorry for the rant, but this is kind of how I'm starting to feel about the whole thing.",Negative,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/mx343v/unpopular_opinion_crypto_sucks_criticism_topic/

We aren't going to see widespread adoption until there is more regulation in place and a safer playground for more risk averse people and institutions to live within. This can live in harmony with crypto as it is today. This of course does assume that the regulations are done intelligently, which is definitely not a given. But I do think it has a solid chance of happening. There's enough money in crypto with folks like the Winklevii and Armstrong that will push the regulation in the right direction.

It has managed to sustain a community of other projects built around it which is actually genius. Sure, the gas fees are a pain and L2 might actually be accomplished way down the line but this doesn't negate its ability/progress or how good a project it really is. To be 2nd to Bitcoin is no small fit, if it were Litecoin and Ripple will be where it is today. My advise: stack as much ETH as you can, the market is wobbly now for sure but guess what? it's still early days and it is you who stacks that's the beneficiary of that first movers advantage being discussed. At r/pbtonline we share a lot of insights about the markets and how you can stack Ether (ETH). Learn and Stack as much as you can while you can.
